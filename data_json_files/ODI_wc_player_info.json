    "description": "Dawid Malan made a striking entry into international cricket in a T20I in Cardiff in 2017, demolishing South Africa's attack with 78 from 44 balls. He deposited the second ball, from Chris Morris, over midwicket for six and never looked back.A bludgeoning left-hand batter with power and panache, Malan was born in Roehampton but brought up in South Africa. He made his first-class debut for Boland in 2005-06. In 2006 he played 2nd XI cricket for Middlesex and Worcestershire, having made his first-team debut for Middlesex in front of 20,000 people in a T20 Cup match at The Oval. As a 20-year-old in 2008, he came in at No. 6 for Middlesex to hit a brilliant unbeaten hundred in a T20 quarter-final against a Lancashire attack containing Andrew Flintoff, Glen Chapple and Dominic Cork. Malan made his Test debut a month after his first T20I, but his first five Tests, against South Africa and West Indies, were far from exceptional, with an average of 23. However, England calculated he possessed fortitude, and at 30, the know-how to handle an Ashes series in Australia. He did exactly that by scoring England's first hundred of that 2017-18 series after they got to the WACA 2-0 down. It was a tough, grown-up innings at a time when England had to answer charges of off-field immaturity. But he was dropped from the Test side after three poor matches in the 2018 summer and it took him three years to make a comeback. Towards the end of 2019, he won a place in England's T20I squad touring New Zealand, and recorded England's fastest century in the format at the time - a 48-ball century in Napier, which played a significant role in the 3-2 series scoreline.He was one of the leading run-scorers in T20Is in 2020 and his half-centuries in South Africa, including an unbeaten 99, took England to No. 1 in the format at the end of the year. Malan himself was the reigning batter in T20Is when he got his Test recall in 2021. But although he was one of three England batters, along with Joe Root and Ben Stokes, to score at least two half-centuries in the Ashes that winter, he was dropped from the side after England lost the series 4-0.Malan topped the run-scoring charts in the 2022 Hundred, making 377 runs at a strike rate of 167 in a title-winning campaign for Trent Rockets, and though he missed the 2022 T20 World Cup final through injury, he picked up a winner's medal that winter, as England became the first men's team to hold both the 50- and 20-over titles concurrently.

    "description": "- For all his big-hitting prowess, Mitchell Marsh has had an underwhelming IPL career so far. Injuries haven't helped. Marsh has been involved in the IPL since 2010 but is yet to have a season where he has played all the games for his franchise. - Marsh has turned out for five franchises in the IPL - Deccan Chargers, Pune Warriors, Rising Pune Supergiant, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Delhi Capitals (DC).- Marsh was first picked in 2010 by Chargers as a 19-year-old. He managed just 28 runs in three games and picked up two wickets. Warriors then splurged US$290,000 for Marsh in the 2011 auction. He played two seasons for Warriors in 2011 and 2013 (he missed the 2012 season because of a back injury). - Between 2014 and 2021, Marsh was part of the IPL in just two seasons. He played three games for Supergiant in 2016, and then a solitary match for SRH in 2020 before getting injured. - Marsh has been more regular since being picked in the IPL 2022 mega auction for a hefty sum of INR 6.5 crore (US$866,000) by DC. He had his best season with the bat in 2022 when he scored 251 runs in eight matches with a top score of 89.- Marsh had an underwhelming IPL 2023 with the bat but picked up 12 wickets at 14.16 - the most for a DC bowler that season.Mitchell Marsh, one of the most well-known surnames in Australian cricket, can bowl 140kph, and is a hard-hitting middle-order bat. He has been an alluring prospect for Australia but has struggled to cement his place at international level despite some outstanding performances on the big stage.Marsh was earmarked for high honours, alongside his brother Shaun, ever since he captained Australia Under-19s to victory in the 2010 World Cup in New Zealand. He played state cricket at just 17, and made his T20I debut at 19 in 2011. He was also a promising junior Australian Rules footballer, and hails from a prolific sporting family - his father is Geoff Marsh, the Australia opener, and later coach and selector; his sister, Melissa, was a professional basketballer.In 2018, Marsh was appointed Australia Test vice-captain in the wake of the ball-tampering scandal, but he was then dropped from all formats and lost his national contract due to a string of failures, at Test level in particular. In 2020 he returned to the T20I fold and the following year, starred on two tours of West Indies and Bangladesh and produced a stunning 77 not out off 50 balls in the T20 World Cup final, helping Australia to their maiden title.  Marsh made it to the Test side over Shane Watson on the 2015 Ashes tour and was given time to settle into the No. 6 role, although his bowling was arguably the stronger feature of his game at the time. That had not been the case in his debut Test series, against Pakistan in the UAE the previous year, when he scored 87 and 47 in his second Test. He never quite settled until a big century at the WACA in the third Test of the 2017-18 Ashes. He followed that with another, in Sydney - brought up amid emotional scenes with his brother at the crease - and then made a pivotal match-winning 96 in a Test win in Durban before Australian cricket plunged into crisis.It was the start of a period of decline for Marsh too. He only played one Test during the 2018-19 home summer, failing twice with the bat against India at the MCG. He returned as part of the Ashes squad in 2019, at The Oval, where he took his maiden five-wicket haul. Later that year, he broke his hand thumping the dressing-room wall at the WACA following a dismissal in the Sheffield Shield, disrupting his career again.He stormed back into Test contention in the 2023 Ashes after four years out of the side, replacing injured allrounder Cameron Green and producing a boundary-studded 118 at Headingley, were it not for which, Australia might have lost more emphatically than they did. In the Old Trafford Test that followed, he made a fifty and held out with a teeth-gritted 31 made over two and a half hours on the final day to secure the series as England threatened to blow Australia's house down. In the BBL, Marsh has turned out most often for powerhouse side Perth Scorchers, winning three titles with them. ",

    "name": "Mark Wood",
    "team": "England",
    "battingStyle": "Right hand Bat",
    "bowlingStyle": "Right arm Fast",
    "playingRole": "Bowler",
    "description": "It looked, for a while, as if Mark Wood would be another of those fast bowlers who promised more than they delivered.An apparently relentless succession of injuries - particularly injuries to his ankle - threatened to either end his career or turn him into another fast medium seamer who compromised his pace for a longer career in the game.But Wood was not to be denied. Abandoning a short run-up that was a characteristic of his career up until the latter part of 2018, Wood instead reasoned a longer approach to the crease would put less pressure on his body and allow him to hit the speeds his early career had promised.The results were dramatic. Returning to the England team for the final Test of the Caribbean tour in early 2019, Wood claimed a maiden five-wicket haul and generated speeds of around 95 mph in a remarkably hostile demonstration of fast bowling. Scyld Berry, the veteran Telegraph correspondent and a man believed to have seen more England Tests than anyone else, rated it the quickest spell he had ever seen by an England bowler.There was more to come. Recalled to the ODI side just before the World Cup, he went on to play a huge role in the team's eventual success. With Jofra Archer he traded records for the quickest deliveries of the tournament - both exceeded 95 mph - and, by offering pace and wicket-taking potential in the middle-overs, ensured his captain always had a potent weapon in the field. While Archer finished with more wickets (21 to Wood's 18), Wood finished with the better strike-rate. Underlining his commitment to the cause, Wood sustained a serious sides strain during the final but, with the match in the balance, continued to bowl at high pace. He was subsequently ruled out of the Ashes series that followed.Wood never did fit the prototype of a modern England fast bowler. He is skinny, barely 6ft tall and, originally at least, bowled from a sprinter's run-up but after his speed caught the eye with Durham and the Lions, he was given a Test debut at the start of the 2015 summer. He made an instant impression against New Zealand, bowling above 90mph and celebrating wickets with abandon, kept his place for the visit of Australia and capped things off by taking the wicket that sealed England's Ashes victory at Trent Bridge. In no time at all, the imaginary horse that had ridden around the county grounds of England to stave off boredom had become a recognisable part of his England celebration. Here was a fast bowler of unsuppressed vitality.Like Stephen Harmison, Wood hails from Ashington in Northumberland and played for the same club. The former England quick also encouraged him to go to Australia at 18 to improve his game - not bad advice from a man who suffered bouts of homesickness away from the Northumberland coast. Where Harmison stands 6ft 4in tall, Wood is a level 6ft and delivers a whippier, skiddier ball. In his first five first-class appearances, he took 19 wickets at 21.63, including a match-winning 5 for 78 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in August 2012.Paul Collingwood's appetite for promoting and encouraging Durham's younger crop of players worked in his favour in 2013. He had a breakthrough summer, claiming 27 first-class wickets at 24.07 to help Durham to the Championship title and confirm his status as the latest in an impressive collection of homegrown pace bowlers. That strong showing was enough to win recognition on the England Lions tour to Sri Lanka, though it lasted only one match before he returned home with a side injury. His 2014 season was further disrupted by the first appearance of a long-running ankle problem but he was again involved with the Lions at the start of 2015 before being called up to the Test squad for the Caribbean.He did not get a run against West Indies but was capped in the washed-out ODI against Ireland, picking up his first England wicket, and then replaced Chris Jordan in the Test side for a Lord's debut. Wood thought he had taken the wicket of Martin Guptill in his third over, only for replays to show he had overstepped, but he eventually finished with 4 for 140 as England won a thriller. Further limited-overs involvement followed but England were already aware Wood's workload would need careful managing - he played the first two Ashes Tests but missed out at Edgbaston. James Anderson's side strain allowed him to return at Trent Bridge and he took one of the two wickets not claimed by Stuart Broad as Australia were dismissed for 60. Two days later, the imaginary horse got an outing after Wood took the wicket that secured the return of the urn.He made a blistering comeback from injury in the second half of 2016, delivering some of the most potent fast-bowling spells of the season as he helped Durham's to the final of the NatWest T20 Blast and also featured in England's 4-1 victory over Pakistan in their one-day international series. But further ankle issues ruled him out of a tour to Bangladesh and he missed India, too, after it was discovered that he bowled at the tail end of the English domestic season when his ankle was fractured. It all meant that he faced a third ankle operation within a year and, however optimistic the prognosis, cast doubts upon the resilience of a player who had won a reputation as England's fastest bowler. His comeback in 2017 was then afflicted by heel problems which limited him to five early-season Championship matches, somewhat down on pace, and saw him lose his England central contract at the end of the season.Lost England contract or not, England could not resist his potential. He sandwiched a disastrous debut in the IPL (conceding 49 in four overs for Chennai Super Kinds and never seen again) in between Tests in Christchurch and against Pakistan at Lord's, where his average pace  of 87mph restated his threat, but his ODI displays were unpredictable and he admitted in Sri Lanka that he was running out of opportunities to claim his place for the 2019 World Cup.Wood played minor counties cricket for Northumberland from 2008 to 2010 before making his first-class debut for Durham against Durham MCCU in April 2011. He made his List A debut against Northamptonshire in Clydesdale Bank 40 the following month and his first County Championship appearance against Nottinghamshire in August of the same year.\n\nESPNcricinfo staff",

    "description": "Mohammed Siraj's rise as a seamer was remarkably swift. The son of an autorickshaw driver in Hyderabad, he only began playing the game in class seven. It was in 2015 that he first bowled with a cricket ball. In 2017, he bagged an IPL contract worth INR 2.6 crore. Months later, he was wearing an India shirt and bowling in a T20 international against New Zealand. Sturdy and athletic, Siraj has a deceptive run-up, which initially suggests that a left-arm bowler is steaming in. He is, however, a right-armer and by his own admission is a natural at getting the ball to swing into the right-hander. He has always been able to bowl a pretty quick bouncer though, something that had impressed his captain David Warner and team mentor VVS Laxman in the Sunrisers Hyderabad set-up. Potential translated to performance when he was his state's highest wicket-taker playing only his second season of Ranji Trophy - 41 wickets in nine matches. He was subsequently picked to play for the Rest of India and was brought on board by the India A team as well for a tour of South Africa in July-August 2017. The step up to the big league arrived soon after. \n",

    "name": "Ben Stokes",

    "bowlingStyle": "Right arm Fast medium",
    "playingRole": "Allrounder",
    "description": "The great Irish sports writer Con Houlihan used to say that every team should have a redhead. And it's true that Ben Stokes' combative nature, allied to his powerful frame and outrageous talent, lifted England to another level. Never was that more true than when he secured his place in English cricket history with an indefatigable batting display in the 2019 World Cup final. In making an unbeaten 84 he exhausted every ounce of strength, talent and willpower and then when he imagined it might be all over he came out to bat once more to help win a Super Over by the narrowest of margins.For Stokes, this was a wonderful moment of redemption because it had been his misfortune until then to be remembered for two episodes he would rather forget. The first came in the 2016 Twenty20 World Cup final in Kolkata. Asked to defend 19 in the last over against West Indies, his attempted yorkers missed the mark by inches resulting in Carlos Brathwaite heaving him for four successive sixes into a sweltering night sky.The second, and altogether more serious, incident occurred in September 2017. Celebrating an ODI victory in Bristol, Stokes became embroiled in a fight outside a club in the early hours of the morning that resulted in his arrest. A trial at Bristol Crown Court subsequently saw him cleared of the charge of affray but by then the reputational damage had been done. He had already missed the 2017-18 Ashes tour - a toothless England were beaten 4-0 with Stokes not considered for selection - and been stripped of the team's vice-captaincy. It was testament to his immense character that he ensured he would be remembered for more positive reasons. Within months of his comeback, Stokes had played a key role in England's 3-0 Test win in Sri Lanka, their first whitewash series victory in Asia. Trevor Bayliss praised Stokes' attitude as \"exemplary\", saying he had \"learned his lesson\". The World Cup final underlined his immense character. Capable of turning games with his batting, his bowling and in the field, he had attracted comparisons with Ian Botham. Expectations were huge from the outset. He had satisfied them.Stokes, from the moment he made his Durham debut, felt very much a product of the northeast of England. He was actually born in Christchurch, New Zealand and came from a rich sporting pedigree with his father, Ged, playing international Rugby League for that country.His prodigious talent was clear from an early age. A true allrounder, Stokes debuted for Durham at 17 and dismissed Mark Ramprakash with his third legal delivery in senior cricket. He enjoyed a productive time at the 2009 Under-19 World Cup, scoring a century against India, before registering a maiden fifty on his first-class debut for Durham. But it was in 2011 that he really began to blossom. In April he took 6 for 68 and scored a brilliant hundred that included five sixes in an over, and a month later registered his maiden limited-overs ton. A broken finger hindered his bowling, but he played for England Lions and made his ODI debut against Ireland in Dublin, going on to play four times against India, albeit with limited impact.A first brush with the management was to follow, after being called up to the England Lions squad for the tour of Australia in early 2013. Stokes ended up being sent home with three matches remaining, along with Kent's Matt Coles, after two breaches of discipline. It was a watershed moment, and he was rapidly rehabilitated back at Durham, playing a key role in their Championship-winning season and being recalled to England's limited-overs teams. He took a maiden ODI five-for and won selection for the 2013-14 Ashes tour, a return to Australia that would command attention for the right reasons.Stokes' performances were a rare bright spot on a disastrous trip. When the agony was all over, only Stokes returned to England as a star on the rise. Brought into the XI at Adelaide, after Jonathan Trott's untimely departure, his pugnacious nature came to the fore during a maiden Test hundred in Perth, a doughty response out of keeping with England's general demeanour throughout the tour.But with fire came combustibility. Stokes missed the 2014 World Twenty20 in Bangladesh after reacting to a dismissal in Barbados by punching a dressing room locker and sustaining a broken wrist. During a difficult year, he was dropped from the Test team after making three ducks in a row against India, and then lost his one-day place on the tour of Sri Lanka - ultimately missing out on selection for the 2015 World Cup.Stokes, like England after a dismal tournament, needed rejuvenating. It began with the Lord's Test against New Zealand, when Stokes scored 92 and 101 after being promoted to bat at No. 6. A successful Ashes followed and he was also a central figure in the new-look ODI side that began to put the World Cup behind them under the guidance of Bayliss and Paul Farbrace. A few months later he produced a barnstorming 258 from 198 balls against South Africa in Cape Town - the fastest England double-hundred in history and the second fastest of all time - during a stand of 399 with Jonny Bairstow.Following his Kolkata nightmare, he nevertheless grew in stature within the side and was promoted to the vice-captaincy (at least until the Bristol episode). He scored his maiden ODI hundred in Dhaka in late 2016 and added four more across international formats the following year, while also taking Test-best figures of 6 for 22 against West Indies at Lord's, becoming a key cog for England despite a chequered injury record.An IPL millionaire twice over - he was bought for £1.7m by Rising Pune Supergiant in 2017, winning tournament MVP, and then picked up for £1.4m the following season by Rajasthan Royals - Stokes was one of the most talked-about players in the world. But there was a sense the best was yet to come. Going into 2019, a year containing an Ashes series and a World Cup, he looked to be a player at the peak of his powers who had finally understood the level of sacrifice and discipline required to coax the best out of his undoubted talent. \nESPNcricinfo staff\n",

    "description": "Adil Rashid did much to set right English cricket's troubled relationship with legspin when he established himself as the country's leading white-ball spinner in 2015 and four years later was a key part of their World Cup-winning side. At the time of Rashid's recall to the limited-overs set-up in 2015, no legspinner had taken more than five white-ball wickets for England; over the next six years, Rashid took more than 200.His success in the limited-overs game owed much to his variation - and his wicked googly in particular - and it was no great surprise when he got his Test debut in 2015 against Pakistan. Rashid took 60 wickets in 19 Tests, but often struggled for control and a long-standing shoulder complaint meant his focus returned to the shorter formats after the 2019 tour of the Caribbean.Born in Bradford, he became the third Yorkshire-born player of Asian extraction to represent the county in 2006, and his 6 for 67  on debut against Warwickshire at Scarborough felt like a breakthrough moment. In 2008, he earned call-ups as a back-up player on Test tours to India and the Caribbean after taking 62 Championship wickets.He made his England debut in 2009 during the World T20, playing in all four of England's games, but had a chastening time on the tour to South Africa the following winter: his only over in the T20I series cost 25 runs and his three overs in an ODI in Centurion were taken for 27. Rashid's county progress was mixed over the next few years but as he reached his mid-20s, he became a more prolific run-scorer, and he thrived with Jason Gillespie as his head coach at Yorkshire, who later took him to the Big Bash with Adelaide Strikers, with whom he won titles in 2014 and 2015. For England, he was part of the side that reached the final of the 2016 World T20 and the semi-final of the 2017 Champions Trophy, and took 11 wickets in the 2019 World Cup. His introduction to Test cricket was brutal as he returned 0 for 163 against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi in 2015, but his 5 for 64 in the second innings demonstrated why England had been so keen to turn him into a red-ball bowler. He was their leading wicket-taker in India in 2016-17 with 23 - 13 more than anyone else - but averaged the wrong side of 35 and leaked 3.70 runs an over.Controversy reared its head in 2018, when, months after signing a white-ball-only contract with Yorkshire, Rashid was handed a Test recall for the home series against India by Ed Smith, a selector keen to think outside the box. He took ten wickets in the series before forming part of a spin trio with Moeen Ali and Jack Leach during England's 3-0 win in Sri Lanka, but after an expensive Test in the Caribbean in early 2019, he was left out once more.However, he remained arguably the pre-eminent asset in England's rebooted white-ball team, and despite despite a long-standing shoulder issue that has required constant monitoring, in 2022 he added the T20 World Cup crown to the 50-over title from 2019. His displays at the sharp end of that competition in Australia epitomised his value - a combined return of 4 for 58 in his final 12 overs of the tournament, including 2 for 22 in the final against Pakistan.",

    "playingRole": "Bowler",
    "description": "- Kuldeep Yadav is the most successful left-arm wristspinner in the IPL. - He was first introduced by Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in 2016 in a continuation of their faith in left-arm wristspin, first starting alongside Brad Hogg and then replacing the veteran Australian.- His form fell away in the 2019 and 2020 seasons, and he missed IPL 2021 due to a knee injury before being let go by KKR.- In 2022, after six seasons with KKR, he was picked by Delhi Capitals (DC). The move seemed to work for him, 2022 being his most prolific IPL season: he took 21 wickets at a strike rate of 14.19, finishing in the tournament's top-five wicket-takers.Kuldeep Yadav started as a fast bowler when he first joined a cricket academy in Kanpur, but was asked by his coach Kapil Pandey to switch to something much rarer - left-arm wristspin. The change wasn't smooth - Kuldeep admitted that he had even tried once - but he soon realised bowling left-arm wristspin was the way forward for him. And he was good at it too, having not only solid control over the length, but also a potent wrong'un among his variations.There haven't been too many bowlers of his ilk in India, and Kuldeep, therefore, attracted immediate attention after successful stints at the Under-19 level.Kuldeep played his first India U-19 game in April 2012 as a 17-year old and and despite consistently taking wickets, he stayed below the radar.  It was the 2014 edition of the U-19 World Cup in Dubai that pushed his stocks higher. After a wicketless spell in the opening game against Pakistan, Kuldeep picked up a hat-trick in the next game against Scotland. \"As Kuldeep, mere ko wicket nikaalna hai (As Kuldeep, I knew I had to take wickets),\" he said after the match.He gained in stature in the games that followed, repeatedly troubling batsmen with his turn and finished with 14 wickets, the joint second-highest in the tournament. The performance seemed to justify why Kolkata Knight Riders' scouts had forked out $66,000 for him in the IPL auction prior to the Under-19 World Cup.Kuldeep had been part of the Mumbai Indians set-up in the 2012 season where he had a fond memory of bamboozling Sachin Tendulkar once in the nets with his wrong'un. That did not translate into an IPL debut. Nor did it happen with Knight Riders in the 2014 season. He had to wait until the Champions League where, playing as a support bowler to Sunil Narine, he impressed with his economy. Following those performances, he was included in India's ODI squad for the series against West Indies in October 2014, and he made his first-class and List A debuts shortly after.Having established himself in the Uttar Pradesh and India A sides, Kuldeep made his Test debut against Australia in a deciding match in Dharamsala in March 2017 and claimed 4 for 68 in the first innings.ESPNcricinfo staff",

    "description": "Cameron Green was earmarked as an international cricket from very early. Contracted to Western Australia as a schoolboy, he took 5 for 24 on first-class debut against Tasmania in February 2017 as a 17-year-old. He was selected initially for his bowling given his 200cm frame and his ability to deliver fast outswing but was plagued by stress fractures. However, throughout his junior days with Subiaco-Floreat and WA's junior teams his technically sound batting and an unquenchable thirst for scoring runs saw him emerge as a genuine allrounder of rare ability. Green didn't play any first-class cricket in 2017-18 and spent the 2018 winter at Cricket Australia's National Performance Centre in Brisbane. His game went to another level in 2019-20 after another stress fracture in his lower back forced him to stop bowling again. He made his maiden first-class century, producing scores of 87* and 121* to force an extraordinary draw against Queensland at the Gabba. He would score two more centuries that summer before posting a career-best 197 from 438 balls against New South Wales in October 2020. That performance led to his first international call-up as he was named in Australia's ODI and T20I squads to face a touring India side which was followed by a Test debut against the same opposition. He made half-centuries in each of his first four series then claimed a maiden five-wicket haul against South Africa the MCG in late 2022 - during a game where he badly broke his finger. Shortly after returning to side in India he made a maiden Test hundred in Ahmedabad.By then, his cross-format skills had caught the eye after a pair of dazzling T20I fifties in India led to a bidding war in the 2022 IPL auction where Green fetched AU$3.15million from Mumbai Indians.\n\nESPNcricinfo staff",

He bounced back later that year with an unbeaten 335 against Pakistan in Adelaide - the second-highest Test score by an Australian - during a home summer in which he received the Allan Border Medal.Prior to his ban, Warner had established himself as one of the best all-format openers in the world. In 2015 his seniority was recognised when he was named vice-captain to Steven Smith in the Test and ODI sides, and he led the limited-overs sides with great success when Smith was rested. It was quite a turnaround for the man who two years earlier had been suspended by Cricket Australia for punching England's Joe Root in a bar-room altercation in Birmingham, and had been warned over a Twitter spat with a pair of journalists. It completed a remarkable rise for a player who burst onto the international scene in 2008-09 as a T20 specialist - he was the first man since 1877 to debut for Australia before playing first-class cricket. His breathtaking 89 from 43 balls on T20I debut against South Africa told the world of his talent, but few at the time expected him to become a key Test player as well.His debut in the baggy green came, appropriately, in Test match No. 2020, against New Zealand at the Gabba in 2011, and in his second game he achieved what Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden never did, carrying his bat through a Test innings. His unbeaten 123 in Hobart could not prevent a historic New Zealand win, but his patience in challenging conditions showed a different side to his batting. Later that same summer he made a very different kind of hundred, a 69-ball one against India at the WACA. In the seven-year period between his debut and the ban, Warner was far and away the best Test opener in the world.Away from international cricket, he has had a prolific franchise T20 career, especially in the IPL, and in 2021 became just the fourth batter to pass 10,000 runs in T20. \n",

Ngidi played for Kwa-Zulu Natal Under-19s at the Khaya Majola week in 2014, where he was spotted by Northerns, moved upcountry to hone his skills at the University of Pretoria, and was identified as a T20 prospect when he was the joint second-highest wicket-taker in the provincial Africa Cup T20 tournament.

His debut ODI series followed, against the same opponent, and brought him eight wickets in three matches.Ngidi took a six-for in the second ODI of the clean sweep of Australia at home just before the pandemic hit. After more than a year out of Test cricket, he took seven wickets in two matches against Sri Lanka at home. He then toured Pakistan and West Indies before getting stuck into his favourite opponents, India, once again, taking eight wickets in Centurion in late 2021, though not in a win this time.\n",

    "description": "Naturally competitive, willing to innovate, capable of changing a game with bat or ball, stunning run-out or implausible catch, David Willey has a lot going for him as a limited-overs cricketer. His attacking approach as a left-arm quick and a clean-hitting batter first won him an international cap against Ireland in 2015 and he was regular member of England's ODI squads through that four-year cycle, but was squeezed out on the eve of the 2019 World Cup by the newly qualified Jofra Archer. The son of former England allrounder turned umpire Peter Willey, David had long been recognised as feisty character on the county circuit before England came calling. Less than a year after his debut, he was a key part of the England side at the 2016 T20 World Cup. With 21 off 14 balls and 3 for 20 from his four overs, Willey would have been a contender for Player of the Match in the final if not for one Carlos Brathwaite.Although he hasn't played a lot of long-form cricket since, Willey started off his first-class career in 2009 with a half-century for Northamptonshire. Initially classed as obdurate, like his father, but with a more orthodox technique, he spent a few seasons of reconnaissance before his combative style began to attract attention. His bowling developed during the 2012 season when he claimed 43 first-class wickets with his brisk swing and seam. The following summer he was central to Northants' T20 success with a memorable all-round performance in the final: a 19-ball half-century (the fastest of the season), a direct-hit run-out from the deep, and a hat-trick to finish off the match as part of a four-wicket haul.A back stress fracture followed by shoulder surgery prevented him from progressing beyond the Lions squad in time for the 2015 World Cup, but he was eventually picked for an experimental England side in Malahide. Further ODI and T20I opportunities followed.In the 2015 Blast, he struck a match-winning century against Sussex in the quarter-final, including 34 off an over from the former England slow left-armer Mike Yardy. He destroyed Warwickshire's top order in the semi-final before Lancashire overcame Northants in the final.At the end of the season, he joined Yorkshire, helping them to Finals Day in 2016, and hitting a career-best 118 from 55 balls against Worcestershire the following summer. His T20 skills also earned interest from overseas - he won a Big Bash title with Perth Scorchers, and an IPL deal at Chennai Super Kings - and it was in that format that he took on the Yorkshire captaincy in 2020.\n",

    "playingRole": "Allrounder",
    "description": "- Hardik Pandya is part of a rare species in Indian cricket - a genuine seam-bowling allrounder - and he was unearthed by Mumbai Indians (MI) in IPL 2015.- Hardik spent his first seven IPL seasons at Mumbai, developing into one of the world's best allrounders, and was part of their title wins in 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020. After injuries began to hinder his ability to bowl, Hardik was released by Mumbai after the 2021 season.- Ahead of IPL 2022, Hardik was signed by new franchise Gujarat Titans (GT) and was appointed their captain even though he had never led any team previously. In his first season as captain, Hardik led Titans to the IPL title and then captained them to the final once again in IPL 2023.- After two successful years at Titans, Hardik was traded back to Mumbai ahead of IPL 2024, and he was appointed MI captain, replacing long-time leader Rohit Sharma.- Hardik's best season as an allrounder was in IPL 2019, when he scored 402 runs at a strike rate of 191.41 and took 14 wickets in Mumbai's title-winning campaign. In 2022, he was the highest run-scorer (487) for Titans as they won their maiden IPL title.Allrounder Hardik Pandya's calling cards brisk seam bowling and powerful ball-striking marked by the ability to hit sixes from the first ball. Hardik, who plays his domestic cricket for Baroda, first caught the eye with an unbeaten 31-ball 61 for Mumbai Indians against Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2015 IPL. That began a long association with Mumbai, where he won four trophies and gained acclaim as a formidable finisher. By the end of the 2022 T20 World Cup, he had come to be seen as a future India captain, thanks to the leadership skills he showed that year in turning an unfancied Gujarat Titans line-up into IPL champions in their first year of existence. Hardik began his India career in 2016 when he was called up for a limited-overs tour to Australia, before impressing with the ball on seamer-friendly pitches in Bangladesh at the Asia Cup. He appeared to be the answer to India's search for a seam-bowling allrounder, and with his sprightly fielding added to the mix, he sealed his spot in India's squad for that year's T20 World Cup. While Hardik batted only twice in the tournament, he bowled the last over against Bangladesh, defending two runs off three balls to help India to a one-run win. A little more than a week after that, Pandya endured the disappointment of bowling a no-ball to reprieve Lendl Simmons, whose unbeaten innings helped eventual champions West Indies clinch the semi-final.Since then, it has not been all smooth sailing. The impact of a serious back injury in 2018 continues to follow Hardik, sometimes limiting him from being able to bowl. And early in 2019, he was embroiled in controversy when he made misogynistic and racist remarks on a talk show, for which he was pulled up by the Indian board.In the 2020s, Hardik grew into his role as a senior player and won praise for his faith in players as a captain and for being a free-thinker. In 2022, after India beat Pakistan in the T20 World Cup, he said he wouldn't have minded losing because the match was so much fun - sentiments he echoed after the 2023 IPL final, where he was all praise for rival captain MS Dhoni, whose Chennai Super Kings beat Gujarat Titans for the title. That year, like in the one before, Hardik turned in an impressive all-round and captaincy performance, making 346 runs and taking nine wickets in Gujarat Titans' run to their second final in a row.",

    "description": "Marnus Labuschagne's ascent to the higher echelons of Test batting was an extraordinary tale of making the most of an unexpected opportunity. During the Lord's Ashes Test against England in August 2019, Steven Smith was felled by Jofra Archer's bouncer and Labuschagne would become his concussion substitute - the first time in Test history the protocol had been used. By the end of the year he had eclipsed Smith as the leading Test run-scorer in the world, and locked in the No. 3 spot, in the midst of a prolific home summer that brought him four centuries in five matches against Pakistan and New Zealand including a double century at the SCG.It was a far cry from a year previously when he had been the shock choice to bat No. 3 against India in Sydney, in just his third Test and with a first-class average in the low 30s, having been a surprise call-up to the 2018 tour of UAE to face Pakistan as Australia began to rebuild following the ball-tampering crisis. Labuschagne was born in Klerksdorp, in South Africa's North West province, to South African parents. His family emigrated to Australia in 2004 when he was 10. He grew up speaking Afrikaans, and only became fluent in English after moving to Australia. Before his international call-up he had been best known for his work as a substitute short leg fielder for Australia taking a superb catch off Nathan Lyon in the 2014 Brisbane Test against India. He made 83 on his Sheffield Shield debut for Queensland in 2014 and was the second leading run-scorer in the 2017-18 Sheffield Shield season scoring 795 runs at 39.75 with two centuries. In his first two Test against Pakistan it was his useful legspin - something he would continue to develop - that stood out as much as his batting as he took eight wickets while showing a glimmer of his potential with the bat in Abu Dhabi. Following the recall against India, he made a composed 81 in the pink-ball Test against Sri Lanka in Brisbane but did not receive a Cricket Australia contract despite being an incumbent in the Test team.What came next was a key part of his story as he signed for Glamorgan for the first part of the 2019 county season where he would churn out 1114 runs in 10 matches, honing his technique against the moving Duke ball and then winning the race for a spot in the Ashes squad.\nESPNcricinfo staff\n",

    "description": "One of Bangladesh's longest-serving and most accomplished cricketers, wicketkeeper-batter Mushfiqur Rahim got his start as a wild-card inclusion for the team's maiden tour of England, in 2005, aged 18, during which he became the youngest player to appear in a Test match at Lord's. Mushfiqur captained in the Under-19 World Cup in February 2006, and featured in a Test in Bogra (that venue's first) against Sri Lanka the following month, though he could make little of the spin of Murali and Malinga Bandara. His first Test fifty came on the return tour of Sri Lanka the following year. Earlier in 2007, he was picked as the first-choice wicketkeeper, ahead of Khaled Mashud, for the World Cup in the West Indies - where he starred in Bangladesh's landmark defeat of India, anchoring the chase of 192 with 56 not out.Mushfiqur came into his own as a Test batter in the 2010s, stepping up to No. 4, shedding the image of lower-order scrapper, taking on the mantle of dependable mainstay, and proving himself one of the better players of spin in the Bangladesh line-up. His first hundred, the fastest by a Bangladesh batter then, came against India in Chattogram in 2010, and was followed two Tests later by 72 and 95 against England at the same venue. After defeats on the Test and white-ball legs of the series in Zimbabwe in 2011, he was appointed captain in place of Shakib Al Hasan, a role he served in for 94 internationals, through to 2018 - though the white-ball part of his tenure lasted only till 2014. Highlights of his term included a first-time place in the Asia Cup final in 2012 and a whitewash of Zimbabwe in a Test series at home in 2014.In 2013, Mushfiqur produced a double-century against Sri Lanka in Galle in a Bangladesh total of 638, their highest. In 2017, there were back-to-back hundreds against New Zealand and India away - though they could not fend off defeats. In Mirpur in 2018 and 2020, he scored double-hundreds against Zimbabwe in back-to-back Tests against them 15 months apart; the first of those made him the first wicketkeeper-batter to score two Test double-hundreds. His favourite opponents, though, have been Sri Lanka, against whom he averages over 50 - boosted, most recently, by consecutive hundreds in the 2022 home series. Against them in 2017, he became the first Bangladesh wicketkeeper to get to 100 dismissals in Tests.Mushfiqur became the first to play 100 games in the BPL, in 2023. He has been among the leading run-scorers in the tournament for a number of years since the league kicked off, turning out for Rajshahi Royals and Khulna Tigers most often.\n",

In limited-overs cricket, he has routinely set his teams off to fast starts as an opener. In any case, few school leavers of his vintage have made such a successful transition to the senior level. The national selectors have taken notice. Having begun his cricket at Colombo's Thurstan College, Samarawickrama moved to St Joseph's in his final years, and prospered in the school system, even hitting a memorable 126 in St Joseph's biggest fixture of the year. That performance propelled him into Sri Lanka's Under-19 squad, where he again impressed, making 265 runs at an average of 44.17 in the 2014 Youth World Cup. While Kusal Mendis - his team-mate from that U-19 side - was fast-tracked to the national side, Samarawickrama would have to earn his place through first-class performances. His first season with Colts Cricket Club was modest, but his second was good, and his third outstanding. Samarawickrama topped Tier-A run charts with 1016 runs at 59.76 in the 2016-17 season. On his debut for Sri Lanka A in February 2017, he cracked 185 runs off 223 balls against a strong England Lions attack. On the back of those runs, Samarawickrama earned a maiden Sri Lanka call-up in September of the same year, for the Tests against Pakistan.Andrew Fernando",

    "description": "Mohammed Shami was India's leading fast bowler in the 2015 World Cup in Australia, when the team marched into the semi-finals and picked up 77 out of 80 wickets on offer. It was later revealed that he had played through that entire tournament - and the preceding Test series against the hosts, essentially four months - through a knee injury. His success can be attributed to his pace, accuracy and primarily his skill in moving the ball - both old and new. There were plenty of frustrating times as well. Shami was hopeful of a return to the Indian team in early 2016, but a hamstring injury ruled him out a limited-overs tour of Australia and the Asia Cup in February. He was selected in a 15-man squad for the World T20 in March, but was unable to break into the XI having spent a year out of international cricket. Shami hails from Uttar Pradesh, but plays first-class cricket for Bengal from where he was noticed. He had played only 15 first-class and 15 List A games when he was drafted into India's ODI team to play Pakistan in Delhi in January 2013. He showed the faith wasn't misplaced and returned figures of 9-4-23-1 in a 10-run win, thus becoming only the eighth bowler, and the first Indian, to bowl four or more maiden overs on his ODI debut. His Test debut, which happened in November that year against the touring West Indies, was even more spectacular. He reverse-swung the old ball appreciably,  and at good pace, in the two-match series to take 11 wickets at 16.54. In the summer that followed in England, Shami and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, recorded the second-highest 10th wicket partnership for India in Tests, when they put on 111 runs against England in Nottingham. Shami's quick promotion to international cricket was the result of impressive performances in the 2012-13 Ranji Trophy: in five matches he took 28 wickets at 21.35, including two ten-wicket hauls, against Madhya Pradesh and Hyderabad. He has also enjoyed early success in the Twenty20 format, picking up 14 wickets in his first eight domestic Twenty20 games, and was signed by Kolkata Knight Riders for the 2011 IPL season. He got his first game for them in 2013, and was acquired by Delhi Daredevils in 2014, who retained him in 2016 despite his missing the entire 2015 season with injury. ESPNcricinfo staff",

    "description": "- For one season, Pat Cummins held the record for the fastest fifty in IPL - jointly with KL Rahul - after he got to the mark in 14 balls when playing for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) against Mumbai Indians (MI) in 2022. Cummins' record was broken by Rajasthan Royals' (RR) Yashasvi Jaiswal in 2023 by one ball.- For a little under two hours, Cummins was the most expensive player procured at an IPL auction when he was sold to Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) for INR 20.50 crore (US$2.47 million approx.) in the auction held a month after he had led Australia to the 2023 ODI World Cup title.- At the same auction, compatriot Mitchell Starc shattered the record when he attracted a winning bid of INR 24.75 crore (US$2.98 million approx.) from Cummins' former team, KKR.- Cummins went on to become the second Australian to lead SRH - after David Warner - despite never having captained any side in a senior T20 competition before.- He was the third Australian captain of an IPL team from Hyderabad. Both Adam Gilchrist, who led Deccan Chargers, and Warner delivered IPL titles before Cummins.Earmarked as a potential star from a young age, Pat Cummins made his Test debut as an 18-year-old but had to wait six years for his next appearance as injuries struck a body that could not withstand the workload. The bowler who emerged in 2017 was a thoroughbred quick who became one of the standout players in the world and, in late 2021, Australia's Test captain in dramatic circumstances.Cummins burst onto the scene with a sensational Test debut, taking a match total of seven wickets to set up a thrilling two-wicket win to square the series against South Africa at the Wanderers. He had made his debut for New South Wales during the 2010-11 season and was particularly impressive in his maiden Big Bash season. Touted to be a future leader of Australia's pace attack, he was offered a central contract for 2011-12, becoming the youngest player to be contracted since the current system was introduced in 1998.Then came the injuries. He suffered repeated stress fractures in his lower back and did not play another Test for six years, until the 2017 tour of India. But all the pain and rehab of those intervening years appeared to have been worthwhile as his body toughened up to the rigours of international cricket.In the wake of Australia's ball-tampering scandal he became arguably the nation's shining light in a cricketing sense. He was absent through the various 2018 winter tours immediately after the controversy due to a back injury but was monumental in the losing home series against India and was subsequently rewarded with the Test vice-captaincy against Sri Lanka. He became the No. 1 ranked Test bowler in the world and claimed Australia's coveted Allan Border Medal as the 2018-19 men's cricketer of the year. He was immense during the 2019 Ashes in England and through another home series defeat against India in 2020-21, typified by a relentlessness with ball in hand and tremendous stamina.Having been identified as a future captain, his rise to the position came earlier than expected when Tim Paine resigned shortly before the 2021-22 Ashes. However, in a mark of the cricketer and leader Cummins had become it was, given the circumstances, almost a seamless transition. A few months later he had retained the Ashes and secured victory in Pakistan on Australia's first tour of the country in 24 years.\nESPNcricinfo staff",

Engelbrecht is a stylish right-hander who has spent time working on his power game as much as his staying power at the crease. He is also a handy offpsinner. He holds a first-class average of just under 40, but most of his runs were scored in South Africa's second-tier competition, including his 214* against Namibia. He has had opportunities at higher levels though. In the 2014 Champions League T20, he was a late replacement to Cobras squad and played a starring role when he defended 11  runs in a Super Over to secure a win over Barbados Tridents. In December 2015, Engelbrecht was cited for a suspect bowling action which was declared illegal. By January 2016, he had reworked his action and tests showed he had corrected it sufficiently to bowl again. He was, however, was cut from the Cobras' contract list for the 2016-17 season. Engelbrecht opted to stay at the Western Province provincial team in the hope of earning his franchise place back.\nFirdose Moonda  \n",

    "description": "At 6ft three inches, Shoriful Islam became a left-arm pace sensation almost overnight, when he starred in Bangladesh's 2020 Under-19 World Cup triumph. He took nine wickets, but it was his aggression and pace in the knockout games against South Africa, New Zealand and (in the final against) India that stood out.They returned home in February to much adulation and many prizes, but shortly afterwards got stuck at home by the Covid-19 pandemic. In the two domestic competitions to kick off the 2020-21 season, Shoriful looked to have taken a step further, and earned a maiden call-up to the ODI side in January 2021, for the three-match series against West Indies.It brought cheer to Nagardanga, the small village in northern Bangladesh where he was born, and from where he would cycle for half an hour to get to the closest bazaar to have electricity, so that he could watch live cricket on TV. When he saw Mustafizur Rahman bowl left-arm pace during the 2015 India series, Shoriful's dream got bigger.The following year, he was spotted by Alamgir Kabir, a bowling coach for Clemon Rajshahi Cricket Academy, during a trial in Dinajpur. Kabir took him under his wing, and taught him how to bowl, and how to be a cricketer. Within a year, he was playing first-class cricket for Rajshahi, and by mid-2018, he would appear for Bangladesh A in two series.Shoriful got transferred into the Under-19 programme where bowling coach Mahbub Ali Zaki built him into a fast bowler from a medium-pacer. Shoriful's World Cup-winning performance took the country by storm, with many expecting him to be in the national team soon. That expectation became reality at the turn of 2021 when he earned his first call-up in the Bangladesh side.Mohammad Isam\n",

    "description": "Born in Mardan, where the standard of batsmanship will always be measured by arguably Pakistan's greatest Test batsman Younis Khan, Fakhar Zaman has been on Pakistan's thankless domestic circuit for over five years with almost no attention. A left-handed opener with an unusually high backlift, Zaman relies on timing for his runs, which he's made plenty of. This is illustrated by his domestic average (42 in first class cricket and 49 in List A). But it wasn't until the Quaid-e-Azam trophy in 2016-17 that his form began to be noticed. Zaman scored 663 runs in the competition at an average of 51, including 170 in the second innings of the final, a game dominated by the twin centuries of former Pakistan captain Salman Butt.However, his prolific form earned him a contract in the PSL with the Lahore Qalandars. He showed flashes of the class he'd been displaying domestically, particularly during a 33-ball 56 against Karachi where he destroyed the opposition bowling and looked extremely elegant while doing so. It earned him a call-up to Pakistan's T20I side for the West Indies tour, and he made his debut in the second match in Port of Spain.His first three T20Is only brought him 26 runs, and much of the world was still unaware of his talent when he made his ODI debut a couple of months later, in England, during the 2017 Champions Trophy. Having missed the opening-match defeat to India, Zaman turned Pakistan's batting fortunes around with scores of 31, 50, 57 and 114 in his first four ODI innings, his strike rate of 113.00 giving a dated 50-overs line-up much-needed oomph at the top of the order. The maiden hundred went on to win him the Player-of-the-Match award in the final, setting up a total of 338 that proved a long way beyond India's reach.Danyal Rasool",

Hendricks made his international debut in a T20I series against Australia in 2014, where he made 49 in the third match. In August 2018 he joined the short list of South Africans to have made a century in their first ODI, cracking 102 from 89 balls against Sri Lanka to seal an away series win.Hendricks rose through the South African domestic ranks with consistent performances in the limited-overs game, first for Griqualand West and then for the Lions franchise. His talent was spotted young, and he was part of South Africa's squad for the Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia in 2008, which met Virat Kohli's India team in the tournament final. Hendricks became a regular starter for South Africa in white-ball cricket in 2018, following a domestic season where he was the first to score centuries in all three South African franchise competitions in a season, with three hundreds in the four-day competition in addition to those in the Momentum one-day and Ram Slam T20 tournaments. In the inaugural edition of the Mzansi Super League later that year, he played a crucial part in Jozi Stars' title win, with 412 runs in eight innings, including back-to-back unbeaten hundreds.In mid-2022, Hendricks hit a rich seam of form ahead of the T20 World Cup, reeling off three fifties in a row against England, followed by 74 and 42 against Ireland in the space of ten days, and added 74 in an away ODI against India a couple of months later.\n",

Stoinis debuted for his home state, Western Australia, at 19, but found opportunities limited there and moved to Victoria, where he got a run in their Sheffield Shield side in 2013-14 and produced an outstanding 170 against Tasmania, a breakthrough innings that led to him becoming a regular in the top order. Stoinis was Victoria's leading run-scorer in the 2014-15 Sheffield Shield season and was called up to Australia's squad for limited-overs matches against England in 2015, where he debuted, playing an ODI and a T20I. He next played an international about a year and a half later, having impressed in first-class cricket in the interim. In his second ODI, Stoinis took three wickets and scored 146 not out from No. 7 to help Australia almost pull off an unlikely victory against New Zealand at Eden Park. That innings gave him an unbroken run in the white-ball sides for about four years, during which time he cemented his position as one of the team's top finishers. That is also the role he has played in the IPL, featuring in all of Delhi Capitals' games in their run to the final in 2020, and doing likewise with Lucknow Super Giants in 2023. In between, Stoinis helped guide Australia to a win in the 2021 T20 World Cup, putting on a remarkable stand of 81 with Matthew Wade in the semi-final against Pakistan after Australia were in strife at 96 for 5 chasing 177. In the BBL, on the other hand, he has been an opener for Melbourne Stars.Stoinis moved back to Western Australia in 2017 for family reasons and was a regular in the first-class side for three seasons, though his returns were middling; he next played when he briefly figured in the title-winning WA side in 2022-23. \n",

    "description": "A left-arm seamer with a fearsome yorker but a chequered injury history, Reece Topley's career was in peril before his 25th birthday as he suffered a series of stress fractures that left him wondering whether he would ever be able to play again.That four years on Topley is regarded as a vital part of England's white ball plans, as a left-armer who deliveries from a great height, speaks of his mental fortitude. In 2022, he grew in both white ball codes at international level, registering the best ODI figures for an Englishman with 6 for 34 against India at Lord's. A sucker-punch came on the eve of that year's T20 World Cup when he rolled his left ankle, rupturing the ligaments, after stepping on a boundary sponge during a fielding drill ahead of England's final warm-up match. He was subsequently ruled out of the tournament. At a skyscraper height of 6ft 7ins, Topley has always towered above his team-mates. An early developer, he first hit the headlines in 2009 when, as a 15-year-old net bowler, his favourite player Kevin Pietersen drilled a drive into the side of his head. He needed stitches but Pietersen left him a signed bat as a more welcome memento.It wasn't until 2011 that Topley started making his own headlines. As a gangly 17-year-old left-arm seamer with huge potential he took 14 wickets for Essex in his three opening Championship matches - including five-wicket hauls in each of his first two games against Kent and Middlesex. That season was interrupted as Topley had to return to Royal Hospital School in Suffolk to start revising for the summer exams. His father, the former Essex player Don, was his school teacher and cricket mentor so slacking in any department was not an option. Topley seemed admirably unaffected by the early hype. At the Under-19 World Cup in Australia in 2012, he stood out as a professional in a boys' game: no one claimed more than his 19 wickets, which came at nine apiece, and Topley relished his status as a senior bowler in England's side. Further recognition - before he had even turned 19 - arrived with an England Lions call-up for the 2013 tour Down Under.The ECB and Essex have been careful to manage his workload, the county rotating him with their other talented quicks. He was a key member of the team in 2013, taking more than 80 wickets in all formats to earn a place on England's Performance Programme trip to Australia. However, a back injury ruled him out of going to Sri Lanka with the Lions, a reminder of how young fast bowlers need protecting.Topley had played for Essex representative sides since the age of nine, but immediately after his England debut in a T20I against Australia in 2015 he announced he was on his way, citing a lack of ambition. Instead, he headed for Hampshire, whose success in the limited-overs game was undeniable. He impressed in the white-ball series against Pakistan and South Africa in the 2015-16, and kept his spot for the World T20 in India despite a chastening outing against AB de Villiers in a T20I immediately before it. But he leaked runs in a high-scoring game against the same opposition in the tournament itself, and was left out for the rest of England's run to the final.But injury struck again, this time in more freakish fashion, in his first season with Hampshire. He failed to bowl a ball after being ruled out for the season during his debut when his left hand was broken when he was hit by a bouncer while batting against Warwickshire's Boyd Rankin. Shoulder surgery followed in the close season and then he suffered another back stress fracture in August 2017 in a season in which he had managed only 112 overs in all competitions. Topley signed a white-ball only deal in 2018 and won an England Lions call-up against India A as a show of faith, allowing him to show some neatly-timed form just ahead of the Royal London Cup final, but he was not selected, and soon needed a pin in his back after a fifth stress fracture. He signalled his wish to move on and was released in September.Sussex took a gamble on him during the 2018-19 winter, allowing him to train and recover at Hove, and he recovered to take 17 wickets in their T20 campaign and play his first Championship games for two years at the end of the season. They were unsurprisingly keen to tie him to a new contract, but were gazumped by Surrey, who became his fourth county when he signed at the end of the season.ESPNcricinfo staff",

A double-century in a school one-day match in Rajshahi grabbed the attention of age-group scouts, who quickly drafted the left-hander into Bangladesh's Under-17s. Soon, he graduated to the Under-19s in 2013, and went on to play two World Cups at that level, in 2014 and 2016.By November 2014, Nazmul had made his first-class debut for Rajshahi and the following year made his maiden first-class century. In the 2016 Dhaka Premier League, where he had his first taste of real competition in the domestic system, he made 537 runs at 41.30. But it was his 2016 Under-19 World Cup exploits - 259 runs at 64.75 - that grabbed the selectors' attention and led them to pick him for the senior team's training camp in Sydney ahead of their 2016-17 New Zealand tour. With Mominul Haque ruled out with a rib injury on the day before the second Test in Christchurch, Nazmul was drafted in to the playing XI, becoming the 84th Bangladeshi to play Test cricket.Mohammad Isam",

    "description": "As inaugural captain of the Greater Western Sydney Giants on their road towards inclusion in the Australian Football League, Alex Carey appeared to be a talent lost to cricket. But the fade of his Australian football career around his 20th birthday left him to fall back on the other sport that had competed for his junior attention, starting a road to becoming Australia's wicketkeeper across formats and also a vice-captain of the ODI side.Carey had always been highly regarded by South Australia, for whom he turned out at age-group levels in addition to his club side Glenelg. On returning home from Sydney, Carey excelled in grade ranks as a batsman, but found the going harder when first chosen for the Redbacks in early 2013. These struggles led the adaptable Carey to make another switch, from full-time batter to a wicketkeeper-batter down the order, and it was in this form that he was able to progress. Amid a strong club and 2nd XI season in 2015-16, he displaced Tim Ludeman as South Australia's gloveman, and earned strong reviews for his precise footwork, soft hands and promising, elegant batting.He took 57 Sheffield Shield catches and two stumpings in 2016-17 and was in the selectors' thoughts entering the 2017-18 Ashes, only to be nipped out of a baggy green by the return of the older, wiser Tim Paine. He quickly replaced Paine in the ODI team and remarkably became vice-captain of both limited-overs teams in the aftermath of Australian cricket's cultural review, cementing his place for the 2019 ODI World Cup. Two years later, he captained the ODI side in a series against West Indies.Carey's elevation to the Test team also came in rather chaotic circumstances after Paine resigned as captain shortly before the 2021-22 Ashes then stepped away from the game. However, although it was a hasty leap into the role, it felt like the natural order.\nESPNcricinfo staff\n",

It was reward for a prolific 2017-18 white-ball season by the left-hander, who scored over 300 runs in the Super Smash and more than 400 in the one-day Ford Trophy.

    "description": "Tim Southee, a right-arm swing bowler, burst upon the international scene in great style. He was still only 19, with only one T20I cap behind him, and fresh from a Player-of-the-Tournament performance at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup when he was handed a Test debut against England in Napier. Southee responded with 5 for 55 before smashing 77 off 40 balls in the second innings with nine sixes.It was a debut that gave a clear indication of the career to come. Over the next decade or so, Southee would go on to form one of the world's best new-ball partnerships with Trent Boult, and would also come to be known for his ability to clear the fence. He hit his 50th six in only his 36th Test.In 2022 he was named as New Zealand's Test captain when Kane Williamson stood down from the role.Pace and outswing are the main tools of Southee's trade. His bag of 18 wickets at 17.33 in the 2011 World Cup prompted Allan Donald to say he had the potential to become the best swing bowler in the world, and though frequent injury-forced absences have kept him from fulfilling that prophecy, he has shown he can be devastating across a wide range of conditions.In 2012, he showed his adaptability in the subcontinent, picking up 7 for 64 in Bangalore, the best figures for a New Zealand bowler in India, before bowling his side to a rare win in Sri Lanka with match figures of 8 for 120 at the P Sara Oval. Two years later, his 11 wickets in the West Indies, at 21.09, helped New Zealand achieve their first series win away from home, against anyone other than Bangladesh or Zimbabwe, in 12 years. In ODIs, his landmark performance came at the 2015 World Cup, when he sliced through England's batting with a sensational spell of swing bowling to finish with figures of 7 for 33, the best bowling figures for a New Zealander in ODIs.Southee was elevated as a stand-in captain in a T20I in 2017 and then an ODI in 2018. But despite standing in as captain and remaining a key Test and T20 bowler, he fell out of favour in the ODI side due to the form of Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson and only played one match in the 2019 World Cup, but was still around the format four years later. \nESPNcricinfo staff",

He has been at the centre of the side since their time in the ICC's World Cricket League Division Five, from where Afghanistan began their rise to the international stage.Nabi took up cricket at the age of 10 while living in Peshawar. Honing his skills with endless sessions of tennis-ball cricket, he managed to begin training at Arshad Khan's academy in Peshawar and made his competitive debut against Rahim Yar Khan Cricket Association in Pakistan's erstwhile Cornelius Trophy in 2003, making 61 after having just met most of his team-mates. On a tour of India he caught Mike Gatting's eye with a century against a visiting MCC side. That brought him more valuable experience with MCC, for whom he made his first-class debut, and he went on to play a major role in Afghanistan's progress to the World Cup Qualifiers in South Africa in 2009.

Nabi has had a couple of stints as Afghanistan's captain, taking over the role from Nawroz Mangal in March 2013 and leading the side to the 2015 World Cup.

    "description": "- Offspinner R Ashwin has played for five IPL teams since his debut season in 2009, and his most recent franchise is Rajasthan Royals (RR), whom he has been playing for since 2022.- With 171 wickets before the start of IPL 2024, Ashwin is among the top-five wicket-takers in IPL history.- Ashwin began his IPL career at Chennai Super Kings (CSK), whom he represented from 2008 to 2015. In the 2011 IPL final between CSK and RCB, MS Dhoni gave Ashwin the new ball and he took the key wicket of Chris Gayle in the first over. Ashwin's 20 wickets in 2011 is his highest tally in an IPL season to date.- After CSK were banned for two years following corruption charges, Ashwin played IPL 2016 for Rising Pune Supergiant and missed 2017 because of injury, before moving to Kings XI Punjab (KXIP, now Punjab Kings).- Ashwin was captain of KXIP from 2018, and in 2019 his mankading (run-out of the non-striker backing-up) of RR batter Jos Buttler became a subject of heated debate.- Ahead of IPL 2020, Ashwin was traded to Delhi Capitals, where he spent two seasons before moving to RR in 2022. At Royals, he was used up the order as a pinch-hitter and became the first batter to retire out tactically in an IPL game.R Ashwin took the tricks and skills he learned playing tennis-ball cricket on the streets of Chennai, particularly the soduku ball, a finger-flicked legbreak, to Test cricket, where he became perhaps the leading offspinner of the first quarter of the 21st century.All through his career Ashwin has been a cricket nerd with a deep appreciation of the nuances of the game and an acute knowledge of his craft. And it was that sharp brain, along with the carrom ball, an equally good arm ball, and masterly control over his offbreaks that made him a quintessential limited-overs spinner early in his career. It was in Test cricket, though, that he became a force after he brought the full scope of his talents to bear on it. His success was desperately needed by India in the time after Anil Kumble retired and Harbhajan Singh was on the wane. Ashwin took nine wickets in his maiden Test, in which he was Player of the Match. In his first 16 Tests he collected nine five-fors, and he went on to be the fastest to 300 wickets and the second fastest to 400, behind only Muthiah Muralidaran.Among the highlights of Ashwin's Test career: 30 five-fors and counting, 90-odd wickets apiece against both Australia and England, and over 50 wickets a year four times. He reached his zenith in the 2016-17 home season, when he took 27 wickets in a three-Test series against New Zealand, 28 in five matches against England, six in a game against Bangladesh, and 21 against Australia in four Tests.Ashwin was picked by Chennai Super Kings in the IPL in 2009, and was one of the rare players who came into the public's reckoning through the IPL and proved himself good enough to have great success in Test cricket. He spent six seasons at CSK, winning the title twice, bowling at the top and the death, and coming on when wickets were required. He was the Man of the Series in the 2010 Champions League in South Africa.He was part of the winning squad in the 2011 World Cup, but got few chances in that tournament ahead of Harbhajan. In the 2015 tournament, he made up with 13 wickets from eight games in India's run to the semi-final. In T20Is his finest hour was the World Cup in 2014, when he took 4 for 11 against Australia, and 11 wickets in all in the tournament, where India lost in the final.An opener with the bat before he took up offspin, Ashwin has been a more than handy lower-order batter, correct, possessed of shots, and with five Test hundreds to his name.\n",

Although he was part of the Kwa-Zulu Natal Under-12 cricket side, his high school scholarship came courtesy of his hockey skills. He was part of the South Africa side that won the 2014 Under-19 cricket World Cup, though he only featured in one match. He was also in the Dolphins squad that played in the 2014 Champions League T20. In the 2015-16 season, he was Dolphins' leading wicket-taker in the 20-over competition, in which they reached the final. Soon after, he made his international debut at the age of 20, and topped the wickets chart in a 5-0 ODI whitewash of Australia in his second series. He went on to play the 2017 Champions Trophy and the 2019 World Cup.Given his modest pace, Phehlukwayo has been lower down South Africa's fast-bowling pecking order in Tests. He made his debut in 2017 but has played only a handful of Tests since.\n",

    "description": "Possessed of a short backlift, powerful forearms and relentless bloody-mindedness, left-handed batsman Kusal Janith Perera's batting is not just inspired by his hero Sanath Jayasuriya's technique, at times, it seems an exact duplicate. Like Jayasuriya, he has a second skill - though it is wicketkeeping rather than slow left-arm, and he was part of Sri Lanka's Under-19 teams, before he joined Colts Cricket Club as a senior. At Colts, Perera quickly set about forging a career founded on aggression and reliability in equal parts, and after two seasons, Sri Lanka's selectors could no longer ignore him. An injury to Kumar Sangakkara saw him earn a place in Sri Lanka's limited-overs squad to Australia in January 2012, where his breezy innings made plain his talent - particularly during a 22 not out at the Gabba that took Sri Lanka home in a low-scoring ODI.  Though a middle-order batsman by reputation, he was promoted to the position of opener in the two Twenty20s that followed, where he continued to play impactful inningsOn return to Sri Lanka, Perera hit a first-class double-ton, then a 275-ball 336, and had proved enough to the selectors to be given a central contract and an extended run in the limited-overs sides.Perera hit his maiden ODI century in Mirpur in 2014 to help Sri Lanka complete a 3-0 whitewash over Bangladesh. He then hammered a 17-ball half-century, Sri Lanka's joint-fastest, against Pakistan in Pallekele in July 2015, to equal Jayasuriya's record.A month later Perera was handed his Test debut against India in Colombo. He made twin fifties, becoming only the second Sri Lanka batsman to score two half-centuries on debut.Perera's burgeoning career hit a stumbling block in December 2015 when he was provisionally suspended from international cricket by the ICC, after having failed a dope test. He was recalled from Sri Lanka's tour of New Zealand and subsequently missed a bilateral T20 series in India, Asia Cup, and World T20.His plight appeared bleak when his initial sample tested positive for the performance-enhancing drug, 19-Norandrostenedione, but it grew bleaker when his B sample returned identical results.Perera had strong support from SLC, though, and also spent a substantial amount of his own money in fighting the WADA-approved lab's findings. His campaign to be cleared included a trip to England for a polygraph test, a hair analysis and a separate urine test, as well as substantial coordination with his main legal team, which was based in the UK. All this eventually paid off when his name was cleared in May 2016, bringing his suspension to an end after five months out - the Qatar-based lab's findings were deemed \"unsustainable\" for \"scientific and technical reasons\" by an independent expert hired by the ICC.ESPNcricinfo staff",

He also scored match-winning hundreds in Harare, and at home against West Indies and Pakistan, the latter two scores coming in the second innings, but more often than not, de Silva was playing with his back to the wall, in the midst of a collapse, like the hundred to save the Delhi Test in 2017 and 46 and 47 not out to help Sri Lanka survive longer in Christchurch in 2023. In the next Test in Wellington, he made 98 in the follow-on. What makes him even more valuable is his ability to chip in with part-time offspin and his reliable fielding in the slips. De Silva plays a similar role with the bat and ball in limited-overs as well - in the 2023 ODI World Cup Qualifier, his 93 helped Sri Lanka survive a scare against a determined Netherlands side.In January 2024, he replaced Dimuth Karunaratne as Sri Lanka's Test captain. De Silva first came to notice after topping the batting charts in the Super T20 Provincial Tournament in early 2016, hitting 234 runs at a strike rate of 133, in six innings. Months later, he was the star of Tamil Union's first victorious first-class campaign in 55 years, hitting 868 runs at 54.25, which featured a crucial fourth-innings 124 in the match that clinched his team the title.

    "description": "When the annals of Bangladesh cricket are sifted by future generations, Shakib Al Hasan will emerge and re-emerge as the greatest cricketer of its first two decades. As a bowler, Shakib is accurate, consistent and canny; aggression and a wide range of strokes are the keys to his batting. Even more importantly, he has self-belief and an excellent temperament, unflustered by the big occasion and ready to do battle against the top teams.The best of his ability and temperament were on display in his first Test as captain, against a weakened West Indies side in Grenada, when Shakib took eight wickets and scored an unbeaten 96 in a tense but successful fourth-innings chase of 215, leading Bangladesh to their first overseas series victory. In only his fourth Test as captain, Shakib scored 87 and 100 - his maiden Test century - in a losing cause against New Zealand in Hamilton, performances that offered further proof of his skill and ability to handle pressure. Against the same opponents in 2008, Shakib took 7 for 36 in Chittagong, only the second instance of a Bangladesh bowler taking seven or more wickets in a Test innings.In ODIs, Shakib's contributions have been equally vital with bat and ball and he became the first from Bangladesh to achieve the double of 2000 runs and 100 wickets. He also became the first batsman from Bangladesh to score five hundreds, despite mostly batting at No. 5.Being clearly the best player in the team, it wasn't surprising when Shakib was handed the captaincy in 2009 after Mashrafe Mortaza repeatedly got injured during his first tenure. His ability to perform consistently and to stay calm under pressure worked well for Bangladesh, as they won 22 out of 47 games under him, and even beat England in the 2011 World Cup. However, the World Cup campaign was followed by a disappointing tour of Zimbabwe, where Bangladesh lost a one-off Test and the ODI series, which led to Shakib's removal as captain.His form hardly waned, however, as he quickly bounced back to help Bangladesh bowl out West Indies for 61 in an ODI; a hundred and five-for in the same Test - something he has done twice - followed later in the year. He remained consistent for Bangladesh and his IPL team, Kolkata Knight Riders, but in 2014 Shakib lapsed into off-field shenanigans that saw him fined for lewdly gesticulating at the camera from the dressing-room during an ODI against Sri Lanka, then suspended for six months by the BCB for misbehaving with coach Chandika Hathurusingha and threatening to quit Bangladesh duty. The ban was lifted early and Shakib made the vice-captain in the ODI and T20 formats under Mashrafe. His match-winning ability was undimmed and he played key roles in Bangladesh wins during their stellar 2015. In the 2019 World Cup, Shakib hit his peak with the bat: playing the No. 3 role, he went past fifty in seven out of eight innings, with a lowest score of 41. That streak included two centuries, including an unbeaten 124 off 99 balls as Bangladesh chased down West Indies' 321 inside 42 overs - a record ODI chase for the country. Shakib finished the tournament third on the batting charts with 606 runs at 86.57, and also took a five-wicket haul against Afghanistan. The highs from that World Cup would dissolve shortly after. Shakib was suspended from all cricket for two years, with one year suspended, after accepting three charges of breaching the ICC's anti-corruption code. He was found guilty of not reporting approaches from bookies during series with Bangladesh as well as at the IPL during his time with the Sunrisers Hyderabad. The suspension would have effectively ended his chances of participating in the T20 World Cup in 2020, but the Covid-19 pandemic meant the tournament was postponed, and that a large part of Shakib's suspension went by without his missing too much cricket with the national team. Shakib was back in the set up soon after, and said he regretted and repented his actions, and that the suspension and the pandemic had made him rethink life.In 2021, he had another run-in with the authorities. This time, during the Dhaka Premier League. Playing for Mohammedan Sporting Club against Abahani Limited, Shakib was caught on video first kicking the stumps and remonstrating with the umpire after his lbw appeal had been turned down, and later ripping them out in anger after the umpire called for the covers when it had begun to rain. He was subsequently banned for three matches and fined Taka 5 lakh (USD 5800 approx).Mohammad Isam & ESPNcricinfo staff",

    "description": "Rated as one half of the best new-ball pair in New Zealand history by Sir Richard Hadlee, Trent Boult is a left-arm quick who presents a significant threat to batsmen around the world with an ability to move the ball both ways even in unresponsive conditions.Born in the Bay of Plenty region in New Zealand's North Island, Boult is, in the words of his brother Jono, a \"normal sort of Kiwi young guy… into his golf and fishing and surfing.\" Cricket, though, was his calling. He lived in a neighbourhood which included eventual New Zealand team-mates Kane Williamson and Doug Bracewell, and had the backing of a supportive household that also kept him grounded. Signs of his skill were evident even as a teenager. As a 17-year-old, he was named the fastest secondary school bowler in the country. A year later, he was representing New Zealand at the Under-19 World Cup.The transition to senior cricket, though, was not quite seamless. Boult suffered a stress fracture of the back in 2009 which put him out of cricket for two years and taught him to concentrate on strength and conditioning. There was speculation that the injury was a consequence of tinkering with his bowling action. So, under the supervision of one of his idols, Shane Bond, Boult reverted to the action he had used as a boy and the results were more than promising. By 2015, he was capable of long spells without wavering too far below the 140kph mark. He became one of New Zealand's irreplaceable players across formats and one of many protagonists in the side's march to their first World Cup final in 2015. Boult had a tough time breaking into the limited-overs sides at first, due to a perception that he doesn't move the white ball as much as the red one. But his effectiveness in Test cricket was too compelling to ignore: he raced past 100 wickets in his 29th match and in 2013, only two years since his debut, he was New Zealand's top-wicket taker. With Brendon McCullum placing a high premium on attacking cricket in the shorter versions as well and Boult proving himself as a bowler who preferred getting batsmen out rather than keeping them quiet, it was a perfect fit. Confirmation came in World Cup 2015 when he ended up the joint-leading wicket taker with 22 scalps in nine matches including 5 for 27 in an epic victory over Australia. His worth in T20 cricket was emphasised by a (approximately) $600,000 payday in the IPL.Boult's strength, according to Northern Districts coach John Pamment, is that, \"he's got a lovely wrist position and the fact that the wrist goes right behind the ball gives him that control.\" Another asset for Boult is friend and sounding board Tim Southee. When on song, their partnership makes for compelling viewing, not to mention telling numbers. In 2014, the pair picked up nearly half the wickets New Zealand took - 67 of 143 - en route to the side's most successful Test year, with five wins in nine matches. The pair have both raced past 200 Test wickets and by 2019 occupy third and fourth on New Zealand's all-time Test wicket-taking list behind Hadlee and Daniel Vettori. Boult was again magnificent in the 2019 World Cup helping lead New Zealand's attack taking 17 wickets. He took a hat-trick against Australia, and the key wicket of Virat Kohli in the semi-final win over India. He bowled the last over and the Super Over in the tied final against England and without some misfortune he may have won the World Cup for his nation. Boult is also among the few fast bowlers who are exceptional fielders, and has a particular knack for one-handed blinders.ESPNcricinfo staff\n",

An all-round performance of 60 runs and a four-for for Rawalpindi against Sialkot in an inter-region Under-16 tournament in 2008 earned him a place in the Pakistan side for the International Under-15 Championship in the West Indies. On the slow pitches of the Caribbean, he changed his bowling style to left-arm spin and transformed into a spin-bowling allrounder, with help from  coach Ameer Akbar and team manager Haroon Rashid. Nawaz studied at the FG Boys School in Rawalpindi but chose to discontinue his college education to focus on cricket instead. In the first four seasons after his first-class debut in 2012, Nawaz scored three first-class centuries and seven half-centuries, tallying 1440 runs, and took 44 wickets at an average of 24.4. Nawaz played for Quetta Gladiators in the inaugural Pakistan Super League and finished as the third-highest wicket-taker in the tournament, with 13 dismissals.

For several seasons in the mid 2010s, spinners were among the leading wicket-takers in South Africa's first-class competition. Maharaj was among them in the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons and was rewarded with an international call-up the following summer.In his youth, Maharaj was a pace bowler, whose father played for Natal B during segregation years. He turned to spin on a whim in the nets one afternoon at school. He found that it worked and stuck to it. Maharaj's secret was his accuracy. At the Dolphins, he was able to combine that with an ability to take wickets at key moments.During the opening first-class match of the 2016-17 season, Maharaj picked up 13 for 157, and was then told he would be on South Africa's Test tour to Australia. Maharaj debuted at the WACA, an unusual place for a spinner, given the conditions, but did a remarkable job. In an innings in which he had to hold one end when Dale Steyn was injured, Maharaj bowled well enough to allow the other two seamers to be rotated at the other side. He took 3 for 56 in the first innings, four in the match, and scored an unbeaten 41 to show great promise for the future.Firdose Moonda",

    "description": "- As of 2024, Mitchell Starc was the costliest player procured at an IPL auction when Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) made a successful bid of INR 24.75 crore (US$ 2.98 million approx.) for him at the auction before the 2024 IPL.- One of the most sought-after players in T20 cricket, Starc had played only 27 matches across the first 15 editions of the IPL, with injuries, international commitments, and personal reasons kept keeping him away at various points.- In the two IPLs that Starc played before KKR got him for 2024, he took 14 and 20 wickets for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), in 2014 and 2015.First there was Johnson, then there was Starc. A left-armer called Mitchell has been a staple of Australia's attack for more than a decade and seems set to remain so for the foreseeable future. While Johnson was more express, Starc is still quick enough to make life uncomfortable for opposition batsmen, especially with the bounce gained from his 1.96m height - and boasts greater control of swing than his former colleague. Never was that shown to greater effect than during the 2015 World Cup, when Starc was at times unplayable, his inswingers rattling stumps and trapping batsmen in front throughout the competition. Not surprisingly he was named Player of the Tournament for his 22 victims at 10.18, and four years later he would claim 27 wickets at the World Cup in England when Australia's defence ended in the semi-finals.His challenge has been to take that white-ball form and perform just as consistently with the red ball, although overall his Test career numbers are also outstanding. He struggled to gain the consistent backing of the selectors early in his Test career and was often in one Test and out the next, but in 2015 he finally enjoyed a solid run of Test cricket until an ankle injury stopped him during the home summer. His career-best match haul of 11 for 94 came in the notable surroundings of Galle - albeit in an Australia defeat - and he claimed 22 wickets in four Tests during the 2017-18 Ashes. He took his 200th Test wicket in his 50th Test in February of 2019 joining an elite group of Australian bowlers although play only one of the five Ashes Tests in the 2019 series. When England toured down under in 2021-22, Starc produced some of his best form in the three matches where the series was decided and went on to claim the Allan Border Medal as Australia's male player of the year.Also a powerful lower-order batter, Starc fell one short of a Test century in Mohali in 2013.

    "description": "For several years, it appeared Mohammad Rizwan's international career would only happen in a parallel universe, racking up domestic runs even as he struggled to get a game in the national side. But for someone who played an international for the first time in two years in January 2019, Mohammad Rizwan was spoken of remarkably frequently. Most often, he was used as a stick to threaten current first-choice Pakistan wicketkeeper and captain Sarfaraz Ahmed, but the Peshawar native had qualities of his own that suggested he might have been unfortunate not to play for Pakistan more often. A limited batsman but a technically sound keeper when he first rose through the ranks, Rizwan made his international debut shortly after the 2015 World Cup when the slot behind the stumps was still up for grabs. He made a bright start against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, averaging nearly 60 with the bat in his first eight innings, but against more challenging opposition, his deficiencies were quickly exposed. A lengthy lean patch followed, and once he lost his place to Sarfaraz for the World T20 in 2016, there was little doubt who Pakistan's No. 1 wicketkeeper was. After the debacle at the World T20, Sarfaraz was appointed captain of the limited-overs sides, and consequently Rizwan's game time diminished further, coming to a complete halt until Sarfaraz sat out the last five games on the tour to South Africa in January 2019 serving a ban. On the domestic circuit, Rizwan has been a prolific run-accumulator, averaging a shade under 50 in List A cricket and 41 at first-class level. He doesn't, however, seem to have the shots necessary to make him a valuable asset in T20Is, but with that being Sarfaraz's strongest suit, both as a batsman and captain, it would have been hard to dislodge him in the format at any rate. Having made his debut over a decade ago on Pakistan's domestic circuit, Rizwan has been an ever-present participant in the Quaid-e-Azam trophy, plying his trade with the hugely successful SNGPL side, helping his side to three titles in the last four years. For that, the reward of a solitary Test cap in 2016 feels somewhat inadequate.He played for Karachi Kings in the Pakistan Super League, serving as back-up to Chadwick Walton for a couple of seasons, but once Sarfaraz Ahmed was dropped from the side, Rizwan's career trajectory skyrocketed.A 95 in Brisbane in his first Test since being called up got him off to a good start, but it was Pakistan's tour to England where he truly cemented his spot as Pakistan's first choice wicketkeeper. A pair of half-centuries in Southampton combined with a near-perfect series behind the stumps demonstrated to Pakistan they have found a long-term wicketkeeping solution, and Rizwan found himself appointed vice-captain of the Test side, and fast-tracked into the white ball team.T20s and Rizwan didn't seem naturally suited to each other, but 2021 has seen him make a mockery of those predictions with a record-breaking year. He began by smashing an unbeaten 104 against South Africa, followed up by seven further half-centuries that saw him amass the most T20I runs in a single year by any player. For good measure, he was also the second highest runscorer at the 2021 PSL - behind only his Pakistan opening partner Babar Azam - and led Multan Sultans to the PSL title. His stability and consistency at the top of the order converted what tended to be a Pakistan weakness into a Pakistan strength. Rizwan now appears to be in the prime of his career, and one of Pakistan's most prized assets heading into the 2021 World T20.Danyal Rasool",

    "description": "A right-hand, top-order batsman known for his discipline and level-headed attitude, Babar Azam laid claim to a long-term spot in Pakistan's batting line-up with a strong performance in 2016, making three consecutive ODI hundreds against West Indies in the UAE, and a 90 in his third Test, in Hamilton. He was 22 years old at the time.Born in Lahore and a first cousin to the Akmal brothers, Azam made his way up through age-group cricket. His journey began at an under-15 world championship in 2008 and he played two under-19 World Cups in 2010 and 2012, where he was Pakistan's top run-scorer.\"We didn't have to guide him, he was on his own, but we were supportive all the way,\" Kamran Akmal said. Azam had the distinction of top scoring regularly in age-group domestic cricket before he was called up to the national side in 2015 and made his debut during the home ODI series against Zimbabwe - a rarity because Azam's rise was during Pakistan's isolation as an international venue due to security concerns. His hat-trick of ODI hundreds against West Indies led to a Test debut in the Test series that followed, and Azam had to opportunity to cement his spot as the careers of Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq wound down.He would grasp that opportunity, and then some. Over the years that followed, Azam became, far and away, Pakistan's best batsman, the most famous cricketer in the country, and among the best batsmen in the world. He is, even with so much of his career still ahead of him, one of Pakistan's best ever batsmen. He was the second fastest player to 2000 ODI runs and the second quickest to 1000 T20I runs. He already has more ODI hundreds than all but two Pakistan batsman, and a World Cup hundred in a crunch game against New Zealand will go down as one of the great individual Pakistan ODI performances. While the first couple of years of Test cricket didn't bring the instantaneous success of white-ball cricket, steady improvements year on year have seen him rank among the best Test batsmen since the start of 2018, too. Several Pakistan players of this generation have seen regressions after a few years in the side, but Azam, mercifully for Pakistan, seems immune to even that malaise. The increased responsibility Pakistan have dumped upon his shoulders - he was appointed T20I and ODI captain in 2019 before eventually captaining the Test side since 2021 - appears to have had little impact on his personal form for now. While he doesn't quite have a reputation as one of the deeper thinkers of the game, his captaincy shows embryonic signs of modern progressive thinking, and Azam is very much learning on the job. There appears to be no attempt to ease any of the pressure placed upon relatively young shoulders, but Azam appears not to be feeling the strain for now. Danyal Rasool",

It was a worthy reward for several outstanding seasons with the Sydney Sixers in the BBL where he was one of the most prolific wicket-takers in the competition and specialised in the death overs. He also became a key figure in New South Wales' Sheffield Shield side consistently taking wickets and providing lower-order runs, playing a crucial part in the Blues 2019-20 title. He was included in Australia's limited-overs tour to England in 2020 but didn't play. He returned to Australia and dominated the start of the Sheffield Shield season. He took 6 for 89 against WA and scored two half-centuries and his maiden first-class century against Tasmania to earn selection in Australia's limited-overs and Test squads for the 2020-21 home series against India. The allrounder debuted for New South Wales at the age of 18. He enjoyed his breakthrough season in 2013-14 when he topped the Ryobi Cup wicket tally with 16 wickets at 20.93. His strong all-round season also brought him 27 Sheffield Shield wickets and he won the Steve Waugh Medal as the best New South Wales player of the season. Abbott was rewarded with a call-up to Australia's one-day and Twenty20 squads to play Pakistan in the UAE in 2014. ESPNcricinfo staff",

    "description": "Mustafizur Rahman is a left-arm pace bowler who came to Dhaka to try out for a fast-bowling camp in 2012, after he had impressed in an Under-17 tournament in Satkhira, some 300km from Dhaka. He got admitted to the BCB's pace foundation and soon caught the coaches' attention to make the Bangladesh Under-19 side for the 2014 World Cup. He made his first-class debut for Khulna in the 2013-14 season and, after taking eight wickets in the U-19 World Cup in the UAE, he was surprisingly picked for Bangladesh A's tour of West Indies. Returning from that short trip, he was viewed as a better bowler and slowly picked up more variations. He initially lacked pace but built it up through the 2014-15 first-class season, when he took 26 wickets at an average of 19.08. This was when Mustafizur started to develop the left-armer's offcutter, which was delivered as a spinner does but with the added ability of making it carry to the wicketkeeper standing back. The story of Anamul Haque's dare that got him to bowl the delivery will go into Bangladeshi cricket folklore, as will the early support he received from Mashrafe Mortaza, who spotted him randomly in the Mirpur nets.Soon enough, the Bangladesh selectors picked Mustafizur for the one-off T20I against Pakistan and then, midway through 2015, for the ODI series against India when he became only the second bowler after Brian Vitori to take five-wicket hauls in his first two ODIs, paving the way for Bangladesh's first-ever ODI series win over India.He was excellent in bilateral series against South Africa - which included a Test debut - and Zimbabwe, while also doing well in his first BPL campaign. Mustafizur's first foray on to the world stage was through the IPL auction, when he was picked Sunrisers Hyderabad in early 2016, followed by confirmation of a contract with Sussex for English domestic limited-overs cricket. He ensured none of his new paymasters doubted their call as he emerged as one of the best bowlers in the World T20, signing off with a five-wicket haul against New Zealand, bamboozling them with his variation of cutters.

He had played only 16 first-class innings before he made his Test debut at the age of 20, and had hit only one first-class hundred before he made a maiden Test ton. That hundred - the 176 against Australia at Pallekele - was a match-flipping, series-defining knock, which given the fact no other batsman mustered more than 55 in the game, is one of the greatest ever Sri Lankan innings. Since then, Mendis has put together some impressive ODI innings as well, and has embedded himself in the Test top four. A highly-rated graduate of Sri Lanka's school cricket system, Mendis' batting had earned him a large following long before he was on the national selectors' radar. As wicketkeeper and flowing right-hand batsman, Mendis won the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award in 2013, for his work in the Prince of Wales College team. He was Sri Lanka's under-19 captain in the Youth World Cup the following year.Mendis began his first-class career for Bloomfield Cricket Club in the Premier League Tournament of 2015. He had a middling first season, hitting 459 runs at an average of 30.60, but continued to be followed closely as Sri Lanka moved to flood their Test team with youth. It was Mendis' excellent returns in the Moin-ud-Dowlah three-day tournament in Hyderabad that paved his route to the national team. He was named in the squad to play West Indies in October 2015, and made his debut in the second match of that series.Andrew Fidel Fernando",

    "description": "The sense that Liam Livingstone is a domineering batting talent who will end up playing all three formats for England was strengthened by an excellent maiden Championship double-century for Lancashire against Warwickshire at Old Trafford in 2017. He had begun the season billed as the \"belligerent face of England's next generation\" after a successful England Lions tour of Sri Lanka, and England took an early look at him with two T20 appearances against South Africa before deciding that he needed more time to craft his game at county level. That double-hundred suggested his research was coming along just fine.Crafting his game did not go well in 2018. He broke a thumb in the Roses match in July which did not help (bizarrely reappearing to bat with a short leg pad as protection) and failed to reach fifty in 10 Championship matches as Lancashire were relegated under his captaincy. He recovered in time for Finals Day in the T20 Blast where his hundred in 49 balls against Derbyshire had provided his greatest satisfaction in a summer he would want to forget.He gave up the captaincy at the end of the season and over the next three years embarked on a globe-trotting T20 journey, ticking off the majority of the world's franchise leagues during English winters to expose himself to different conditions and roles. His form led to an ODI debut in early 2021 and a T20I recall exactly four years after his debut against Sri Lanka. The following month, he blitzed the fastest-ever T20I hundred by an Englishman, off 42 balls against Pakistan at Trent Bridge, then cleared the new stand at Headingley and embarked on a six-hitting rampage in the first season of the Hundred.Livingstone, a hard-hitting batsman from Barrow in Cumbria, won a trophy in his first season in Lancashire colours when they triumphed at Edgbaston on Finals Day in the 2015 NatWest Blast. His satisfaction did not come without mishap, however, after he was glassed (and deemed an innocent party) in a late-night incident in an Ashford bar after the quarter-final win against Kent and needed around 20 stitches. A first-ball duck, bowled by Northants' Shahid Afridi, added to his misery in the final, but Lancashire were hopeful that, at the very least, they had a big hitter on their hands.He had first attracted media attention as the season began by striking 350 in 138 balls for his club side Nantwich in a mismatch which saw them beat Caldy by 500 runs. It was held to be one of the largest individual scores in any officially-sanctioned limited-overs fixture. He had moderate success in 2015-16 in Australian club cricket with Perth, but Lancashire's coach, Ashley Giles, gave the 22-year-old opportunities in all formats and was rewarded when he topped Lancashire's Championship batting averages, building on a maiden first-class hundred against Somerset in Taunton.  A 21-ball fifty against Yorkshire equalled what at the time was Lancashire's quickest in Twenty20. England Lions' interest was quickened and two intelligently-compiled hundreds in Sri Lanka spoke of a batsman more adaptable than many had imagined as well as one who possessed useful attributes as either legspinner or offspinner as the situation demanded.\nESPNcricinfo staff",

He took them to their maiden IPL title in his first season as captain and went on to lead MI for 11 years before he was replaced by Hardik Pandya for the 2024 season.- Rohit is MI's top-scorer and one of only four batters with more than 6000 runs in the IPL. His only hundred - 109* against Kolkata Knight Riders - came in IPL 2012.- Rohit's best IPL season with the bat was in 2013, when he scored 538 runs in MI's title-winning campaign. In 2015, Rohit was the Player of the Final as Mumbai beat Chennai Super Kings to win their second IPL title. MI went on to win the IPL in 2017, 2019 and 2020 under Rohit's leadershipLanguid and easy on the eye, Rohit Sharma owned all the shots in the book when he emerged from the Mumbai suburbs as heir apparent to the Indian batting greats of the 2000s. It took him time and persistence, but by the 2010s he had become a colossus in white-ball cricket, and the man in charge of perhaps the most formidable league team in the first age of T20.That Rohit had talent was apparent to both the casual observer and to the trained eye. Fans were frustrated at the long wait for the potential to translate into runs, though selectors and captains, knowing better, kept backing him. At one point the word \"talent\" was Rohit's bugbear, a pejorative nickname for him on social media. Once it all clicked, though - the move to open the batting in ODIs late in 2012 was one particular turning point - things came together spectacularly.Rohit scored ODI double-hundreds for fun, won six IPLs in the first 15 editions of the tournament, scored five hundreds at the 2019 ODI World Cup, and when he finally got to open in Tests in 2019, three quick hundreds in his first series in the role, one of them a double. Ironically his IPL franchise nicknamed him \"Hitman\" when he was anything but: more caresser, less hitter. But Rohit still became known as one of the foremost hitters of colossal sixes of his era. So spectacular and certain was his acceleration that people began anticipate a massive score every time he went past 50.His captaincy at Mumbai Indians, whom he led to five titles, won plaudits. He proved himself a methodical, studious and calm leader, one not averse to using technology and data to arrive at decisions. He was an able deputy to Virat Kohli in limited-overs formats in international cricket, winning India two titles in Kohli's absence, and took over as captain in all formats in 2022.",

He first tasted success in franchise cricket with Titans in the 2007-08 season, when he topped the wicket-takers' chart in the MTN Domestic Championship, finished third in the Standard Bank Pro20 Series, and contributed handy runs in both tournaments. Titans won both titles and van der Merwe harvested a clutch of player-of-the-year titles. The following season, his 30 wickets were pivotal in the team retaining the MTN title.He marked his T20I debut, against Australia in 2009 with a quickfire 48 and 1 for 30 and was named Player of the Match. He played 26 games, split evenly between ODIs and T20Is over a year, for South Africa before calling time on his international career with them. Between then and when he first turned out for Netherlands in 2015, having acquired a Dutch passport, he plied his trade as a T20 journeyman, with gigs in the IPL with Royal Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Daredevils, and with Somerset in England's T20 Blast, while still appearing for Titans.Van der Merwe got off to a brisk start in T20Is for Netherlands, taking two wickets apiece in each of his first four games, in 2015. In June 2019, he produced a breakneck 75 not out against Zimbabwe, and in the game after, took 4 for 35 - though Zimbabwe won that match in the eliminator after it was tied.As he entered his late 30s, van der Merwe continued to ply his trade around the world, though primarily as a bowler as his batting became less consistent. At the T20 World Cup in 2022, playing for Netherlands, he took a stunning high catch off David Miller to help his side secure a famous victory - one which knocked his old team, South Africa, out of the tournament before the semi-finals.His longevity was confirmed when, in early 2023, he finished the inaugural SA20 as the leading wicket-taker for champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape.ESPNcricinfo staff",

He batted in every position from No. 1 to 9 in limited-overs cricket, and also took on the responsibility of being a wicketkeeper. In Tests, however, Latham was primarily used as an opening batsman, and he quickly settled into a position New Zealand had trouble filling for years.Latham had been part of New Zealand's Under-19 World Cup squad in 2010 and later that year he played first-class cricket for Canterbury. In 2012, he made his debut in ODIs and Twenty20 internationals and was shuffled up and down the order for a while but did not cement his spot. Following an impressive domestic season, Latham played his first Test, against India in Wellington, in February 2014 and was picked as an opener for the tour of West Indies a few months later. In the Caribbean, he reeled off three successive half-centuries, contributing to an overseas series win. Against Pakistan in the UAE that November, Latham scored centuries in successive Tests, the first New Zealand batsman to do so for 24 years. He has been a fixture at the top of New Zealand's order in Test cricket ever since. In December 2018, he carried his bat in a Test innings against Sri Lanka in Wellington, making 264 not out to set a new Test match record for the highest score by any opener while carrying his bat, surpassing Alastair Cook's 244 not out in 2017 against Australia. He was also only the second New Zealand opener to carry his bat in a Test. Glenn Turner had previously done it twice. In ODI cricket, he was included in New Zealand's 2015 World Cup squad, but did not get a game as Brendon McCullum's team finished runners-up. However, New Zealand rested several first-choice players from the tour to Africa later that year, and Latham cashed in: he made his maiden ODI hundred in Zimbabwe, and scored three successive half-centuries in South Africa - all while opening the batting. He had had only one 50-plus score in his first 26 ODI innings. After a lean run in 2017 at the top of the order, he was shifted to No.5 and given the gloves following the retirement of Luke Ronchi. He made 103 not out in his first innings at No.5 in a winning chase against India in Mumbai and remained in that spot all the way through to the 2019 World Cup.\nESPNcricinfo staff",

Henry would make his Test debut at Lord's on the subsequent tour of England and made an immediate impression taking 4 for 93 in the first innings.

But he saved his best spell for the winning semi-final at Old Trafford where he ripped through India's top order, claiming 3 for 37 including the tournament's leading scorer Rohit Sharma. He also took the key wicket of Jason Roy in the epic final against England at Lord's. Henry stays consistently over 140kmph, likes to bowl full, and had only taken four five-fors in 14 first-class games spread over three seasons when he was called up for what initially looked like an apprenticeship with the New Zealand senior team.ESPNcricinfo staff",

That hundred - the 176 against Australia at Pallekele - was a match-flipping, series-defining knock, which given the fact no other batsman mustered more than 55 in the game, is one of the greatest ever Sri Lankan innings. Since then, Mendis has put together some impressive ODI innings as well, and has embedded himself in the Test top four. A highly-rated graduate of Sri Lanka's school cricket system, Mendis' batting had earned him a large following long before he was on the national selectors' radar. As wicketkeeper and flowing right-hand batsman, Mendis won the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award in 2013, for his work in the Prince of Wales College team. He was Sri Lanka's under-19 captain in the Youth World Cup the following year.Mendis began his first-class career for Bloomfield Cricket Club in the Premier League Tournament of 2015. He had a middling first season, hitting 459 runs at an average of 30.60, but continued to be followed closely as Sri Lanka moved to flood their Test team with youth. It was Mendis' excellent returns in the Moin-ud-Dowlah three-day tournament in Hyderabad that paved his route to the national team. He was named in the squad to play West Indies in October 2015, and made his debut in the second match of that series.Andrew Fidel Fernando",

Born and educated in Negombo, Shanaka made his T20 international debut against Pakistan in August 2015, but it wasn't until the following domestic season that he achieved wide acclaim. Batting at No. 4 in an AIA Premier T20 match against Saracens Sports Club, Shanaka struck a Sri Lankan record 16 sixes in an innings worth 123 from 46 balls. That wasn't even his biggest T20 score of the last week. He had hit 131 off 48 balls against Galle Cricket Club one week earlier.But it was with the ball that Shanaka first made his mark on the international stage. He took 3 for 16 on a Pune greentop, against India, having only taken two domestic T20 wickets before then. He played bright cameos in Sri Lanka's 2016 World T20 campaign, and in April he was picked in the Test squad - for Sri Lanka's tour of England -  for the first time, largely on his potential, rather than his first-class record.Andrew Fidel Fernando",

    "playingRole": "Allrounder",
    "description": "Sam Curran, younger brother of Tom Curran, his fellow Surrey all-rounder, and son of the former Zimbabwe cricketer Kevin Curran, fulfilled his destiny at the age of 19 years and 363 days, when he made his Test debut against Pakistan at Headingley in June 2018. One Test later, he scooped his maiden Man-of-the-Match award, after four first-innings wickets and a thrilling counter-attacking half-century had given England the edge in a gripping Edgbaston Test against India. His success merely heightened the debate as to whether batting or bowling will ultimately become his strongest suit. Perhaps the only real conclusion to that debate is it does not matter. Curran has developed into an X-factor cricketer of global repute. He was player of the T20 World Cup in 2022, taking 13 wickets at 11.38, with an economy rate of 6.52, emerging as a canny death bowler to take England to glory. He signed off with a player of the match performance in the final against Pakistan, taking 3 for 12. Punjab Kings subsequently made him the most expensive buy at an IPL auction, outbidding five other teams to acquire his services for INR 18.50 crore (£1.85 million approximately). Back in 2018, the same franchise - Kings XI Pubjab, as they were known at the time - purchased him for INR 7.2 crore (£800,000 approximately). It was at the IPL, while playing for Chennai Super Kings, he showed his dexterity as a makeshift opening batter, having primarily been used as a hitter down the order. His absence from Test duties in 2022 was more through circumstance than design. A back injury ruled him out of the 2021/22 Ashes which took time to shake off. Now, however, both player and national team are aligned. As a leftie in both disciplines, his skillset is a rarity as far as English red ball bowling stocks are concerned, and his composure with bat in hand has never been questioned. Having fallen in the nineties twice in first class cricket, he finally made it to three figures in June 2022 with 126 against Kent. It was his 120th innings in the format. Curran has belied his slight frame from the moment he entered Surrey's 1st X1 in 2015, showing a natural ability to swing his left-armers at a decent lick and full of ambition at the crease. The combative nature of his cricket marked him down as a special cricketer in the making, winning attention from England Lions at the end of the 2016 season.Curran made an eye-catching Championship debut against Kent at The Oval when he took five wickets in the first innings, eight in all in the match, at only 17. Surrey research suggested he was the youngest-ever player to achieve a five-wicket haul in the Championship and the second youngest Surrey debutant. He opened the bowling with his brother, Tom, and took a wicket with his fifth ball when an inswinger bowled Joe Denly. At 17 years and 40 days old, his first-class debut came 69 years to the day after Tony Lock, the youngest player to play for Surrey at 17 years and eight days, made his first appearance - also against Kent - at the Oval on July 13, 1946. He showed an ability to swing the ball into the right-hander from the outset. That there was aggression, too, was evident even before his debut when he filled in for a Surrey T20 practice match and struck Gary Wilson on the helmet with one of the first balls he bowled. His laid-back personality was also evident when he was given a day off school by Wellington College, where he was taking A levels in PE, Art and Business Studies, to play in a Royal London Cup semi-final against Nottinghamshire at The Oval, where he first came to the attention of a wider audience with a composed, energetic display.Two successive runners-up medals in the Royal London Cup final, as Surrey lost Lord's finals against Gloucestershire and Warwickshire, were not a bad start for a player still only 18, but such is Curran's competitive nature, it is doubtful that he found much consolation in either of them. In a 2016 summer that brought so much to admire with bat and ball, there was a 96 against Lancashire - ended when a tame return catch to the offspinner Arron Lilley was followed by a disconsolate walk from the crease, in the words of ESPNcricinfo's reporter, as if he had just lost a game of Pokemon Go - and four wickets in seven ball against Durham on the way to the first six-for of his Championship career.\nESPNcricinfo staff\n",

    "description": "- Quinton de Kock made his IPL debut in 2013 for Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) but was only given three games. A quiet season followed in 2014 after he was bought by Delhi Capitals (then Delhi Daredevils).- In his second season with Delhi, he scored two half-centuries in three games and finally had his breakout season in 2016. He scored 445 runs, hitting his maiden century in the tournament as well.- After a disappointing season with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in 2018, he was snapped up by Mumbai Indians (MI).- De Kock went past the 500-run mark both in 2019 and 2020, forming a dangerous opening partnership with Rohit Sharma to help Mumbai Indians win back-to-back titles.- New franchise Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) bought him at the IPL 2022 mega auction and he enjoyed a stellar season, scoring 508 runs as they made it to the playoffs.- He hammered a career-best unbeaten 140 not out off 70 against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in IPL 2022, as he and KL Rahul put on an unbroken 210 to break the record for the biggest opening partnership in the tournament's history.Quinton de Kock's fearless striking and handy glovework earned him comparisons to greats of the game like Adam Gilchrist and Mark Boucher early in his career. By 21, he shared the record for the most successive ODI centuries - three - before it was bettered by Kumar Sangakkara. A year later, he had established himself in all three formats for South Africa. De Kock grew up as a baseball player and even considered a move to the United States, but his father convinced him to pursue cricket instead. He attended King Edward VII High School, the alma mater of Graeme Smith and Neil McKenzie, and was picked for the South African U-19 side, which he captained briefly. He also topped the batting charts for South Africa in the 2012 junior World Cup in Australia.Later that year he caught the national selectors' eyes when he starred in a match-winning partnership with McKenzie in the Champions League T20 against Mumbai Indians. He also finished fourth in the first-class rankings in the 2012-13 season. After a bit of a false start to his international career - he didn't do much against New Zealand and Sri Lanka in 2012 and 2013 - he scored his first ODI hundred against Pakistan later that year. Then came the three in a row against India, followed by his Test debut early in 2014. An ankle injury threatened to put de Kock out of the 2015 World Cup, but he recovered quickly - if only to struggle through that tournament and a series against Bangladesh, after which he was dropped and spent some productive time in the A team. His first Test hundred came against England in Centurion in 2016, and he followed that up with one against Australia three matches later in Adelaide, in a series South Africa won 2-1. He also hit his stride in the shortest format, scoring his maiden half-century in the T20 World Cup that year, in which he was South Africa's most successful batter. Elsewhere in T20, he was a key part of the Mumbai Indians side that won two IPL titles on the trot at the tail end of the 2010s, opening their batting and keeping. In late 2021, de Kock announced a shock retirement from Tests, becoming another in a growing list of top all-format players seeking to concentrate on the white-ball formats.\n",

Bowling predominantly with the new ball, he took eight wickets in the first three games of that series and 7 for 19 in the fourth, where Afghanistan successfully defended 134. The month after, he starred in a historic U-19 Asia Cup title win for Afghanistan, taking 5 for 13 as his team beat Pakistan in the final.Early in 2018, at the U-19 World Cup in New Zealand, he took 4 for 14 to beat the home team and set up a semi-final against Australia. That week he was signed by Kings XI Punjab (for about US$630,000) for whom he took 14 wickets in that year's IPL. By the time he played that tournament, he had become the youngest to take five wickets in an ODI - against Zimbabwe in a Sharjah bilateral game that February which Afghanistan won comfortably - at the age of 16 years and 325 days. He had also helped beat West Indies with a four-wicket bag in the final of the World Cup Qualifier tournament in Harare that March, taking Afghanistan to their second World Cup; Mujeeb was the joint-highest wicket-taker in the Qualifier, with 17 wickets.By the end of that eventful year, he was much in demand as a T20 gun for hire, having made his debuts in the T20 Blast in England (for Hampshire), for Nagarhar Leopards in the first edition of the Afghanistan Premier League, and in the BBL for Brisbane Heat, with whom he played for four seasons before moving to Melbourne Renegades in 2022.In the 2021 T20 World Cup, Mujeeb started with a bang, taking 5 for 20 in a crushing win against Scotland - though Afghanistan didn't do much of note in the tournament.\n",

One of the fastest bowlers in Sri Lanka's system, Kumara possesses a sharp bouncer, and an ability to both swing and seam the ball - all allied to a bustling intensity.He had played in the Under-19 World Cup in February, but it was on a u-19 tour of England that he put himself into contention for higher honours. He took a series-high 13 wickets at an average of 18.30 through the Youth Tests, and was especially effective at Northampton, where he claimed first-innings figures of 7 for 82, then a further 4 for 52 in the second innings to send England Under-19s to their first home defeat in six years.Injury layoffs for Dushmantha Chameera, Nuwan Pradeep and Dhammika Prasad then opened up a spot for Kumara in the Test team.

But he played just one game that season before being released in IPL 2016.- Thakur was traded to Rising Pune Supergiant (RPSG) in 2017 and then went to Chennai Super Kings (CSK) at the IPL 2018 auction for INR 2.4 crore - this was after he had made his international debut. He stayed with CSK for four seasons from 2018 to 2021.- The 2021 season was Thakur's most fruitful in the IPL, where he finished joint-third on the purple cap list with 21 wickets in 16 matches.- Thakur was picked up for a whopping INR 10.75 crore by Delhi Capitals (DC) in the IPL 2022 auction and was then traded to Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) ahead of IPL 2023. - Thakur, a two-time IPL winner with CSK in 2018 and 2021, will return to his old franchise for IPL 2024 after being acquired in the auction for INR 4 crore.An aggressive quick bowler, who can swing the ball away from the right-handers even while hitting the pitch hard, Shardul Thakur has established himself as the spearhead of Mumbai's attack. With the new ball, Thakur's at-the-batsman method forms a neat counterpoint to Dhawal Kulkarni's more metronomic style, and the two combined brilliantly to win Mumbai their 41st Ranji Trophy title in February 2016. Thakur picked up eight wickets in the final against Saurashtra, and his dismissal of Cheteshwar Pujara on the third day, the ball rearing up from a length to hit the shoulder of the bat, was perhaps the ball of the match.Thakur hails from Palghar, a town 87 km north of Mumbai, and spent his early cricketing years lugging his kitbag on early-morning trains into the city. Mumbai won the Ranji Trophy in his debut season of 2012-13, but he did not play a major role in the triumph, picking up only four wickets in four matches at an average of 82.Told to lose weight by his Mumbai team-mates, Thakur came back leaner and fitter the next season, and picked up 27 wickets at 26.25. The 2014-15 season was even better, Thakur finishing joint-top of the Ranji Trophy bowling charts with 48 wickets at 20.81. That earned him a call-up to the India A squad for four-day games against Australia A and South Africa A. Later that year, playing for the Board President's XI, he bagged a four-wicket haul against the touring South Africans, his wickets including those of Faf du Plessis and Hashim Amla.Kings XI Punjab signed Thakur for INR 20 lakhs at the 2014 IPL player auction, but he only got to play one match in his first two seasons for the team.\nESPNcricinfo staff\n",

    "description": "- Kane Williamson became the first New Zealand player to win the orange cap in the IPL when he scored 735 runs for Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in 2018. At the time, he was only the fourth overseas batter to score over 700 runs in an IPL season after Chris Gayle (twice), Michael Hussey and David Warner. - Ahead of the 2024 season, Williamson's tally remains the fifth-highest in an IPL season behind Virat Kohli (973 in 2016), Shubman Gill (890 in 2023), Jos Buttler (863 in 2022) and Warner (848 in 2016).- Williamson also holds the record for the third-most runs in a season as captain, behind Kohli and Warner (both 2016). - Williamson led SRH to the final of IPL 2018 where they lost to Chennai Super Kings (CSK). Overall, he captained SRH in 46 matches, the second-highest behind Warner's 67.- Williamson has been part of two champion squads, SRH in 2016 and Gujarat Titans (GT) in 2022, but didn't feature in the final in either of those years.By the time Kane Williamson is finished with playing cricket, it is probable that he will be New Zealand's greatest batsman. Even Martin Crowe endorsed that view. But he may also finish as one of the game's most loved global figures. Williamson is ambidextrous, bats right-handed in the top order across formats, and has become a pillar of the New Zealand side since he made his debut in 2010.Williamson was born into a sporting family in Tauranga, the largest city in New Zealand's Bay of Plenty region. His father had played Under-17 cricket for Northern Districts, his mother was a representative basketball player, and his sisters played volleyball at age-group level. Williamson took to cricket and it grew beyond a hobby quite quickly.He was modest about his skills, too, - \"Everyone is gifted, I guess, but you get some that seem exceptionally so. I'm not one of them,\" - yet Williamson was billed to make it since he was 14. He scored a century on Test debut at the age of 20, and at 24 years and 151 days he was the youngest New Zealand batsman to 3000 Test runs- younger than Don Bradman too.At the crease, Williamson is comfortable against pace and spin, and he trusts the coaching manual explicitly despite the mutation of batting in the Twenty20 era. Among his best performances is his maiden Test double-century in January 2015, which helped New Zealand come from behind and beat Sri Lanka in Wellington. The innings was a testament to Williamson's hunger for runs and batting time - he was dissatisfied despite making 242 in over 10 hours.Williamson has made his orthodoxy work and is capable of scoring at a brisk tempo - he has a T20 hundred for Northern Knights and became the quickest New Zealand batsman, and fifth overall, to 3000 ODI runs. For a measure of his consistency, he has two streaks of five or more successive fifty-plus scores in ODIs in 20 months since 2014.He is rarely drawn to emotion and is a genial, but hard, competitor - Williamson once struck the winning six in a roller-coaster, one-wicket win over Australia in the 2015 World Cup, and celebrated with a smile and the calmest of fist pumps as Eden Park exploded in raucous jubilation. Williamson is also an outstanding catcher and a part-time offspinner, though he needed to remodel his bowling after being banned from bowling in international cricket in June 2014 for an illegal action.With the mental strength to match his skills, Williamson was an automatic choice to take over the captaincy at the World T20 in 2016, soon after the retirement of the inspirational Brendon McCullum. Williamson led the team to four back-to-back victories in India, and was highly praised for his tactics that helped the team adapt to slow, turning pitches, before they were beaten by England in the semi-final.In 2018, Williamson led New Zealand to two famous Test series wins. In April, he became the fourth New Zealand captain to win a series against England. In December, he was the chief architect of New Zealand's first away Test series win over Pakistan in 49 years, with 89 and 139 in the final Test. He became the first New Zealander to score 20 Test centuries in 2019 with an unbeaten double century against Bangladesh at home. But he elevated himself into the global pantheon of greats at the 2019 World Cup, where he was not only named player of the tournament but he carried himself with unprecedented class as the trophy was snatched from New Zealand's hands by England in the greatest final of all time. He made two match-winning centuries against South Africa and West Indies and a vital 67 in a famous semi-final win against India to get New Zealand to a second successive World Cup final. His captaincy and calmness among the mayhem of a tied final and tied Super Over was extraordinary. His conduct in the aftermath having lost the Cup on a one-off tie-break provision where the team with the most boundaries wins, was even more incredible.\nAlagappan Muthu",

Imam ul Haq answered that question emphatically right at the get-go, stopping conspiracy theorists and cynics who cried nepotism - his uncle is chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq - with a glorious start to his international career. A hundred against Sri Lanka on debut made him the second player from Pakistan to reach three figures in his first match. He followed that up with a splendid outing in Zimbabwe, where he scored three centuries and became the first player in ODI history to score four hundreds in his first nine matches.A bespectacled, slight young man with a deferential, curious note running through his voice, Imam is a ruthless accumulator at the crease. A left-handed opening batsman descended from arguably Pakistan's greatest batsman of all time, Imam is particularly strong on the drive and off his hips. He looks to have faith in his abilities even in high-pressure moments, though he is admittedly yet to be tested in truly demanding conditions or the highest quality of opposition; he was unwittingly done a favour when he was benched for most of Pakistan's disastrous ODI tour of New Zealand at the start of 2018.His start to Test cricket hasn't quite been as eye-catching, though an unbeaten 74 in the fourth innings of his debut match prevented Pakistan from falling to an astonishing defeat against the debuting Test nation Ireland. In the two Tests that followed in English conditions, he appeared susceptible to the moving ball - Stuart Broad dismissed him in all three innings, twice by trapping him lbw. He has the technique and level head to be able to succeed in red-ball cricket, and upcoming home tours of Australia and New Zealand provide him the perfect opportunity to make his mark as a long-term opener in both longer formats.Danyal Rasool",

    "description": "Daryl Mitchell was called into New Zealand's Test team in late 2019 as a replacement for the injured Colin de Grandhomme. He impressed, too, making an assured 73 against England in his first innings and bowling with good control on a sluggish surface at his home ground, Hamilton. He had made his international debut against India in a T20I in February of that year.Mitchell scored his maiden Test hundred at the start of 2021, in an innings win over Pakistan in Christchurch, and his first ODI century that March. In T20Is, when promoted to open at the 2021 World Cup in the UAE, Mitchell played a key role in New Zealand's run to the final, with an unbeaten 72 against England in the semis. Though New Zealand had a poor tour of England in 2022, losing all three Tests, Mitchell came out of the summer glowing, with two fifties and three hundreds, including 190 at Trent Bridge.He made his first-class debut at the end of the 2011-12 season and came to prominence by averaging 54.53 the following year. And though he was primarily a middle-order batter, his seam bowling became a useful asset over the years. He won a place in the New Zealand A squad to tour India and Sri Lanka, and while he found life tougher there, he responded with centuries in successive innings the following domestic season. An unbeaten 170 against Canterbury shortly before the England series in 2019 ensured he was in the selectors' thoughts, and when de Grandhomme was forced to pull out of the second Test, Mitchell was selected.He is the son of former New Zealand rugby union player and coach John Mitchell, who, at the time of his son's Test debut against England, was defence coach for the England rugby union side that lost in the World Cup final.\n",

    "description": "A robust batting technique, nagging consistency with the ball, athleticism in the field, and an imperturbable temperament made Angelo Mathews one of Sri Lanka's most prized assets, although persistent injuries and several standoffs with the Sri Lankan board prevented him from achieving his full potential.In limited-overs cricket, Mathews' all-round skills have been indispensable. When he pulled a quad in the World Cup semi-final in 2011, it forced three changes to the XI that played in the final, as the team strove for the balance he could single-handedly deliver. He began his international career with ambitions of becoming a genuine allrounder, but over time came to give primacy to his batting, effectively playing as a specialist batter in the Test side, providing solidity to the lower-middle order. Against Pakistan in December 2013, he batted for seven and a half hours to make an unbeaten 157 (having already scored 91 in the first innings) and save a Test in Abu Dhabi. Mathews had an outstanding 2014, in which he scored 1160 Test runs at an average of 77.33, his finest moment being a rousing 160 at Headingley, which transformed that match and saw Sri Lanka win their first Test series in England (not including the one-off Test in 1998). He had also starred in Sri Lanka's victorious T20 World Cup campaign earlier that year, scoring 40 off 23 balls in the semi-final against West Indies and conceding only 25 runs for a wicket in the final against India.He took over the captaincy in 2013, leading Sri Lanka to the series win in England, but after an embarrassing ODI series loss at home to Zimbabwe in 2017 and an early Asia Cup exit in 2018, Mathews found himself dropped from the one-day team altogether, specifically for his running between the wickets.He batted for over seven hours to save the Wellington Test in December 2018, dropping on to the pitch after getting to his hundred to do ten push-ups and then flexing his biceps to let his coach know what he thought of being called cricket-unfit. He tore a hamstring in the next Test and was ruled out for four months. As if that wasn't enough drama, Mathews took a wicket off his first ball in the 2019 World Cup, not having bowled for eight months before that.Despite the many injuries in the second half of his career, Mathews reached the 100-Tests milestone in 2022, becoming the 12th man to be dismissed for 199 in a Test in the process.\n",

    "description": "A left-handed batsman and left-arm spinner, Mitchell Santner was first elevated to the New Zealand side after a promising 2014-15 domestic season. He was named in the one-day squad for the tour of England following the retirement of Daniel Vettori after the World Cup as New Zealand searched for another left-arm spin option. Santner was in to cover for the absence of the players at the IPL but made an immediate impression with a well-crafted 94 in a tour game against Somerset. He was handed his ODI debut at Edgbaston having played just 19 List A matches for Northern Districts. \"It's nice to have a left-arm spinner who turns,\" was a quip from the New Zealand camp.He made his Test debut later that year in the first ever day-night Test against Australia in Adelaide and made 31 and 45 batting at No.6 in both innings in a low-scoring game. He also took two wickets. Over the next four years his Test opportunities were limited but he became a mainstay in the white-ball teams for the Black Caps. His performances were so impressive that he was bought by the Chennai Super Kings in 2019 IPL to play under Stephen Fleming. He won a game by hitting a six off the last ball of the match against Rajasthan and took 2 for 13 from 4 overs in the IPL final against Mumbai, including the prized scalp of Rohit Sharma. His experience in that cauldron held him in good stead for the 2019 World Cup in England. He bowled a clutch spell in the semi-final win over India, strangling their middle order to help secure a spot in the final against England. Later in the same year he recorded a maiden Test century during an epic partnership with BJ Watling. The 261 they added was New Zealand's highest seventh-wicket stand in history and helped their side to 615-9, their highest Test total against England. The three wickets he claimed in England's second-innings also constituted new Test-best figures and helped New Zealand to a crushing innings victory.\nESPNcricinfo staff",

Known chiefly for the turn he generates and the flight he fearlessly trusts, Sodhi's journey to top-level cricket has been a triumph of determination over significant odds.Born in Ludhiana, in the Indian state of Punjab, Sodhi began his cricket in south Auckland, where his parents had migrated in his youth. Papatoetoe High School is not renowned for its cricket, and perhaps as a result, Sodhi had trouble establishing himself in regional representative teams, and may have also been a victim of Auckland's pitches that provide little aid to spin bowlers, and captains who are not versed in how to use them. Undeterred, Sodhi left school early and a training stint with Dipak Patel and Matt Horne was when his career finally got some traction. A move to Northern Districts allayed the frustration of not being able to displace the spinner in the Auckland side, and after an encouraging 2012-13 season, Sodhi earned a trip to the subcontinent with New Zealand A, which cleared the path to the New Zealand side.Andrew Fidel Fernando",

It took him another three years to break into the senior side, but when he did, he made an impact right away with 97, 143 and 125 in his first three Tests, at home against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. He did well against tougher opposition as well, making 94 in a comprehensive win over India in Centurion in January 2018 and two big hundreds against Australia in the contentious Sandpapergate series two months later. But overseas success took a while to come - after disappointing tours of India and Sri Lanka, Markram made his first away Test hundred in a second-innings effort in Rawalpindi in February 2021, showing he had the technique to navigate pitches that turned and stayed low. His 108 gave South Africa a fighting chance, but they eventually lost the series 2-0.

    "description": "A baby face perched on a two-metre body, Shaheen Afridi's story is trademark Pakistani. An 18-year old already comfortable in the green shirt of the national side, he's been on the radar of the national selectors for almost three years. In a more intimate circle, he was destined for great achievements well before his teenage years, with an international cricketer for an elder brother.Riaz Afridi made his solitary Test performance for Pakistan in 2004, when Shaheen was just four years old. He pushed Shaheen to hard-ball cricket following years of the younger brother enjoying success in Pakistan's informal tape-ball circuit. In 2015, FATA selected him after an U-16 talent hunt programme. His pace, physique and fitness won him an U-16 tour of Australia, and since then, he's been progressing through the youth squads. He burst into the nation's consciousness with 8 for 39 on Quaid-e-Azam Trophy debut, the best-ever figures by a debutant in the competition. Later, he was picked for the PSL, where figures of five wickets for four runs in a group game for Lahore Qalandars won him a place in the T20I squad against the West Indies. He became the first cricketer born after the turn of the millennium to represent Pakistan when he played the third T20I against the West Indies. He was later handed an ODI debut in the Asia Cup, where he replaced Mohammad Amir in the side. In December, he became the 35th player to make his Test debut for Pakistan under the age of 19.There is more to him than just his story, however compelling that may be in its own right. He stands at an imposing 6ft 6in, though a sweet, child-like smile and a harmless demeanour perhaps takes some of the aura away. He has the intelligence to take advantage of his height to extract bounce on the docile pitches of the UAE, while a mean yorker has proved especially difficult for batsmen to deal with. Most impressively, he can hit a good length time and again, and appears to have the temperament for a long career at this level. There have been flattering comparisons already, with Pakistan boasting a rich tradition of left-arm fast bowling. In truth, he really is nothing like Wasim Akram or Mohammad Amir, both of whom were shorter bowlers who relied more on swing than bounce. Perhaps the most accurate contemporary comparison is to Mitchell Starc, something Mickey Arthur pointed out during the PSL earlier this year. He has made an impressive start to international cricket, but for Shaheen, many sense this is indeed, just the start. Danyal Rasool\n",

He had made his Sheffield Shield debut at the age of 18 in the 2011-12 season and over the next few summers he established his place in the South Australia batting line-up and was a consistent contributor, though a maiden century proved elusive despite his regular scores in the nineties. In February 2015, Head was named captain of the Redbacks and at 21 became the state's youngest captain of all time. He had been viewed as a future leader ever since he captained South Australia to the Under-19 National Championship title in 2012-13 and was named Player of the Championship. As captain of South Australia he showed maturity beyond his years, and in 2015-16 steered them to their first Sheffield Shield final in 20 years, along the way scoring 721 runs himself at an average of 36.05. In 2018 he earned his first Test call-up of part of a new look Australia side which faced Pakistan in the UAE. He played 16 consecutive Tests, scoring a maiden hundred against Sri Lanka in Canberra, before missing the final match of the Ashes series but returned for the home season and notched a second ton in the Boxing Day Test against New Zealand.He was dropped again midway through the 2020-21 series against India but remained prolific at domestic level. The following season he was preferred ahead of Usman Khawaja for the final middle-order spot and produced a thrilling, match-defining 85-ball century which came within a session.

He batted in every position from No. 1 to 9 in limited-overs cricket, and also took on the responsibility of being a wicketkeeper. In Tests, however, Latham was primarily used as an opening batsman, and he quickly settled into a position New Zealand had trouble filling for years.Latham had been part of New Zealand's Under-19 World Cup squad in 2010 and later that year he played first-class cricket for Canterbury. In 2012, he made his debut in ODIs and Twenty20 internationals and was shuffled up and down the order for a while but did not cement his spot. Following an impressive domestic season, Latham played his first Test, against India in Wellington, in February 2014 and was picked as an opener for the tour of West Indies a few months later. In the Caribbean, he reeled off three successive half-centuries, contributing to an overseas series win. Against Pakistan in the UAE that November, Latham scored centuries in successive Tests, the first New Zealand batsman to do so for 24 years. He has been a fixture at the top of New Zealand's order in Test cricket ever since. In December 2018, he carried his bat in a Test innings against Sri Lanka in Wellington, making 264 not out to set a new Test match record for the highest score by any opener while carrying his bat, surpassing Alastair Cook's 244 not out in 2017 against Australia. He was also only the second New Zealand opener to carry his bat in a Test. Glenn Turner had previously done it twice. In ODI cricket, he was included in New Zealand's 2015 World Cup squad, but did not get a game as Brendon McCullum's team finished runners-up. However, New Zealand rested several first-choice players from the tour to Africa later that year, and Latham cashed in: he made his maiden ODI hundred in Zimbabwe, and scored three successive half-centuries in South Africa - all while opening the batting. He had had only one 50-plus score in his first 26 ODI innings. After a lean run in 2017 at the top of the order, he was shifted to No.5 and given the gloves following the retirement of Luke Ronchi. He made 103 not out in his first innings at No.5 in a winning chase against India in Mumbai and remained in that spot all the way through to the 2019 World Cup.\nESPNcricinfo staff",

But there was evidently enough encouragement around his potential for the Desert Vipers to recruit him for the inaugural ILT20 at the start of 2023. A connection between the Vipers and Hundred side Oval Invincibles helped - they share the same analytical team - but spells across his 10 appearances, with nine dismissals and an economy rate of 7.81, suggest it was a shrewd acquisition. His pace, along with a smooth run-up, was particularly noteworthy.A tall seamer educated at Bradfield College, Atkinson earned a professional contract in October 2017 after impressing for Surrey's second team throughout the previous summer. He performed creditably with the ball across the next two seasons, but without ever threatening to break into the first team - though an unbeaten hundred from No. 7 against Worcestershire in a Second XI game at the back end of 2018 hinted at a future as a bowling allrounder. He graduated to the 1st XI outright in 2020, with a List A debut coming in 2021. Even though his part in the 2022 summer was limited, he still managed 13 wickets at 28.84 to aid the push for the Championship title, and grew his reputation in white ball cricket as a handy option at the death. \n",

Litton was picked in Bangladesh's Under-19 side in 2012, the year after he made his first-class debut, and over two U-19 World Cups, that year and in 2014, he cumulatively averaged over 50, with a century and three fifties.A compact batter with a good defence and flair, Litton made 44 in his first Test, against India in Fatullah in mid-2015, and followed that up with a fifty that helped fetch a first-innings lead against South Africa in Chattogram. In Bloemfontein two years on, he top-scored for Bangladesh with 70 after the home side racked up a massive total. He made 94 against Sri Lanka in the match after that, but his first Test hundred took nearly another four years to materialise, coming late in 2021 against Pakistan, in Chattogram again. He top-scored in the second innings of that game too, with 59, but Pakistan won thanks to a feeble performance by the other Bangladesh batters. That match came near the start of a nine-Test purple patch, spanning about 11 months running from mid-2021, in which Litton averaged a little under 60, making three hundreds and five fifties, including 102 after Bangladesh followed on in Christchurch.In the thrilling ODI Asia Cup final in Dubai in 2018 that India won off the last ball, Litton set up the game, scoring 121 in an innings where eight of his team-mates failed to get double figures. The following year, he played a co-starring role in the ODI World Cup win over West Indies in Taunton, making 94 in a massive partnership with Shakib Al Hasan.In the BPL, he has been a fixture for Comilla Victorians, featuring in three title-winning sides in his first six seasons with them and being their top scorer in 2022-23, one of those title-winning years.\n",

His 17 wickets at 17.05 in the National One-Day cup in 2016 was a key part of him being promoted to the Pakistan side. Peshawar Zalmi head coach Mohammad Akram had been monitoring this process at the domestic circuit and snapped him form the emerging category in Pakistan Super League.Hasan made a smooth transition to international cricket, grabbing two five-fors in his first 15 ODIs and impressing with his tight lines on his Test debut - which coincided with the farewells of Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan - as Pakistan pulled off a last-gasp win in Dominica. Still, no one could quite imagine the impact he would have on his first global tournament, the 2017 Champions Trophy.Much like his team, Hasan began the tournament badly, going for 70 in his ten overs in a heavy opening-match defeat to India, before turning his form around in unexpectedly dramatic manner. Taking three wickets in each of Pakistan's next four matches, he finished as the tournament's leading wicket-taker with 13 at an average of 14.69, while only conceding 4.29 an over.

    "description": "An allrounder who bowls tidy offspin and bats in the middle order, Mahmudullah has spent the last three years figuring out how fickle form can be. In late 2012, he was the star who derailed West Indies to their first ODI series defeat in Bangladesh, and was a step away from captaincy. A poor season later, his place was continually questioned and he was even dropped for the 2014 Asia Cup. After another five months, Mahmudullah finally found form and became an automatic choice.Born in Mymensingh, a district located 115km to the north of Dhaka, Mahmudullah learned his game in his hometown before coming to the capital to take part in the ACC U15 tournament in 2000. He played in the 2004 U19 World Cup at home, and the following year made his first-class debut for Bangladesh A. He also spent part of that year in the MCC Young Cricketers and became a regular club and first-class cricketer back home in the 2005-06 season.He made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka in 2007 and was labeled a limited-overs specialist for some time and he delivered in short bursts, hardly setting the world on fire. But his eight-wicket haul on Test debut (including a five-for in the second innings) against West Indies in 2009 spurred him on as he suddenly averaged 193 with the bat in the ODI tri-series against India and Sri Lanka later that year.It got better as he slammed his one and only international hundred, in a one-off Test against New Zealand in Hamilton. The crowd held their breath as he drove the fast bowlers imperiously through the covers, fleetingly drawing comparisons with India's VVS Laxman. \nHis most telling contribution so far has been the 159 runs he made against West Indies in the home ODI series in 2012. He was holding the innings together as well as playing the match-winning role. The next two years were a struggle, but after a reasonable performance against Zimbabwe in the 2014 winter, he confirmed his place in the 2015 World Cup squad.Mohammad Isam",

    "description": "- Suryakumar Yadav, also known as SKY, is one of the most inventive and explosive batters in T20 cricket, drawing comparisons with AB de Villiers for his 360-degree range of shots.- While SKY is a crucial part of the Mumbai Indians (MI) line-up going into IPL 2024, his career in the IPL had a slow start.- SKY was part of the MI squad in the 2012 and 2013 seasons but played only one game, in which he was dismissed for a duck.- In 2014, SKY was bought by Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) but they failed to get the best out of him. He played for KKR for four years and did not score more than 200 runs in any IPL season.- In the 2018 IPL auction, MI bought SKY once again and he had his breakthrough season, scoring 512 runs at a strike rate of 133.33.- Since then, SKY has become a force at No. 3 and enjoyed his best IPL season in 2023, when he smashed 605 runs at a strike rate of 181.14. He has won two titles with MI, in 2019 and 2020.Hard-hitting 360-degree batter Suryakumar Yadav has all the shots, including a few not in any textbook save the one written by AB de Villiers. He also has a yen for making batting look easy, as he showed during four golden years with Mumbai Indians starting in 2018, during which they won the IPL title twice, thanks in no small part to his 1700-plus runs at a strike rate of around 140.He made 73 on his Ranji Trophy debut, for Mumbai in 2010, and the following season scored 754 from nine games, the most by anyone from his team. That tally included a double-century against Orissa in his third match of the season, and a hundred in the next. He capped the season with yet another hundred, in the Duleep Trophy. After a blip in 2012-13, he was back among the runs the next season, where he finished among Mumbai's top three run-getters.Suryakumar spent four seasons with Kolkata Knight Riders, starting in their second IPL title-winning year, 2014, though with 608 runs from 54 games he didn't quite provide a foretaste of what he would go on to do with Mumbai Indians in the years that followed.  Suryakumar's first international came belatedly in 2021, whereupon he hooked the first ball he faced in a T20I, from Jofra Archer, for six. He produced two fifties in his first three T20Is, and the year after, made 117 off 55 in a game where India fell short in the face of a massive 215 by England.\n",

    "description": "- Rashid Khan became the first Afghan player to play in the IPL when he debuted for Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) at the IPL 2017 curtain-raiser.- After five seasons with SRH, he was snapped by Gujarat Titans (GT) in 2022, helping them win the IPL in their debut season. - In 2023, Rashid had his best season at the IPL yet, finishing second on the wickets charts with 27. On his way there, he registered the 22nd hat-trick in IPL history, dismissing Andre Russell, Sunil Narine and Shardul Thakur in three balls for Titans against KKR. - Before the start of IPL 2024, among bowlers with 50 or more wickets in the Indian Premier League, Rashid was the most economical of all (an economy of 6.66 from 109 games between 2017 and 2023).Rashid Khan has been Afghanistan's first global superstar, and the key to their successes in their early years in international cricket. His extraordinarily effective legspin has made him one of the greatest T20 bowlers ever, among the first names on wishlists of teams in leagues all around the world. Not a big turner of the ball, he puts batters under pressure with his speed through the air, like his bowling idol Shahid Afridi, while maintaining a stump-to-stump line. His biggest weapon is an accurate googly, and he has variations aplenty. With bat in hand he is more than capable of clearing the boundary late in an innings, and he has airbrushed many a middling total into a match-winning one for his team. Rashid was just 17 when he made his ODI debut on Afghanistan's tour of Zimbabwe in October 2015. Less than two years later, he was snapped up by Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL for close to US$600,000. After a superb 17-wicket first season with them, he picked up franchise deals with Guyana Amazon Warriors - for whom he took the first-ever hat-trick in the CPL in 2017 - and Adelaide Strikers, with whom he won his (and their) first BBL title in 2018. He scaled new heights for Afghanistan as well, taking 5 for 3 in a T20I against Ireland to keep a record 11-match T20I winning streak alive, and later in 2017, taking his country to a win over West Indies in their first ODI in the Caribbean with 7 for 18. He was duly honoured as the 2017 ICC Associate Cricketer of the Year. The following year, he became the youngest cricketer to top the ODI bowling rankings, the youngest man to captain an international side, and the fastest to 100 ODI wickets.In Afghanistan's inaugural year in Test cricket, Rashid took five second-innings wickets in their first win, against Ireland, and six months later made an important fifty and took twin five-fors, finishing with 11 wickets in a famous win over Bangladesh in Chattogram. In 2021, he took 11 again, this time in a win over Zimbabwe. In his five seasons with Sunrisers, he was a totemic presence, taking 93 wickets at an economy rate of 6.33. When he moved to Gujarat Titans in 2022, he took 19 wickets in a run that led the side to the title.\n",

    "description": "Having relinquished his South African qualification to sign a contract with Leicestershire, taking advantage of an EU passport, Colin Ackermann was part of the late-2010s exodus that rocked cricket in his home country. Although less heralded at the time, Ackermann was a former South Africa U-19 who had topped the Sunfoil averages in 2016-17, and might have been in contention for a Test call-up had he not taken the well-trodden English county route.His returns in county cricket were mostly solid rather than spectacular, and when he did grab the headlines it was with his occasional offspin - figures of 7 for 18 in a T20 Blast game against Birmingham Bears making him the first man to take a seven-wicket haul in the format. He captained the T20 team in his first season at Leicestershire, taking on the job full-time the following year, and in 2019 stepped up to lead the 50-over side; as well as topping the run charts in both limited-overs formats. The following summer he was unveiled as club captain, a sign of his growing importance to the county, and in 2022 he made history as his career-best 277 not out helped Leicestershire to their highest first-class score, 756 for 4 dec, and a Championship-record fifth-wicket stand of 477 with Wiaan Mulder (235 not out)Ackermann had previous experience in the county of Leicestershire after enjoying a successful season for Kibworth in 2012. He is a product of Grey High School in Port Elizabeth, with whom he toured England. He was the leading run-scorer in the CSA Under-19 three-day competition in 2009, where he averaged 200 with two centuries.However, when his international debut did arrive in late 2019, it was in the orange of Netherlands, and he went on to help secure qualification for both the 2020 T20 World Cup (postponed to 2021) and the subsequent event in Australia in 2022, at which his unbeaten 41 was instrumental in one of the biggest shocks of the tournament's history, as his former countrymen South Africa were eliminated in a 13-run defeat in Adelaide.\nESPNCricinfo staff\n",

    "description": "A tall and accurate fast bowler who is unrelenting in his line and length, Josh Hazlewood became a fixture in Australia's Test attack as soon as he made his debut in December 2014. Although he was only 23 at the time, the baggy green had felt a long time coming, given that Hazlewood had been highly regarded for so long. At 17, he had become the youngest fast bowler to be selected by New South Wales, and at 19 he was in his first one-day international against England at Southampton, joining Craig McDermott and Ray Bright as the only Australian 19-year-olds to play the format so soon. Hazlewood was initially chosen for Australia's Test tour of India in late 2010 but was withdrawn due to a back stress injury, and it was not until four years later that he finally played his first Test, having added significant strength to his 196cm frame.Hazlewood grew up with Glenn McGrath as his idol and was handed a rookie state contract for 2008-09, despite still being in year 12 in Tamworth, in country New South Wales. At the time, he had not even played a game for a Sydney grade club. But the observers who had seen something in Hazlewood were to be justified, as he statistically kept pace with McGrath, or near enough to it, during the early stages of his international career. Both men had made their Test debuts at 23 and Hazlewood reached 100 Test wickets in 46 innings, just one innings slower than his idol. Along the way, Hazlewood was only once dropped from the side: mentally and physically fatigued, he was left out of the fifth and final Ashes Test in England in 2015, despite a collection of 16 wickets at 25.75 in the series. When the Ashes next came around, in 2017-18, he claimed 21 wickets in Australia's 4-0 victory.After the leadership upheaval following the Newlands ball-tampering scandal, he was named joint vice-captain of the Test team but missed the tour of the UAE due to a back issue. Another back injury following the 2018-19 home series against India saw him replaced as vice-captain and miss out on the World Cup squad, having been part of Australia's successful campaign in 2015, but he was the man who claimed the wicket to retain the Ashes at Old Trafford a few months later.\nESPNcricinfo staff\n",

He made his Somerset first-class debut against the Pakistan tourists and followed up with T20 and List-A debuts for the Club in the same season, catching the eye in a NatWest T20 Blast fixture at Cardiff where he bowled with genuine pace.

    "description": "In the winter of 2022-23, Harry Brook announced himself as one of the world's most exciting young players with a staggering run of form across formats, most particularly in England's rebooted Test team. After making his debut against South Africa in September 2022, Brook travelled to Pakistan and New Zealand with Ben Stokes' team, where he peeled off consecutive scores of 153, 87, 9, 111, 89, 54, and 186 to take his overall tally to 809 runs in nine innings, at an extraordinary strike-rate of 98.77. No player in Test history had started with a bigger bang - Vinod Kambli had 796 runs after his own ninth innings - and not even Brook's anticlimactic tenth innings (run out without facing in England's thrilling one-run defeat at Wellington) could take the gloss off his achievement. By then, Brook was also a T20 World Cup winner, after featuring in England's triumph in Australia earlier in the winter, and at the IPL auction in December, he was snapped up by Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs 13.25 crore (£1.3 million).A former England U19s captain, Brook had flickered in Yorkshire colours over the first couple of years of his professional career, most notably when scoring a maiden first-class hundred at Chelmsford in 2018, as the visitors recovered from being bowled out for 50 in their first innings to inflict defeat on reigning champions Essex. He recorded a List A hundred at the start of Yorkshire's 2019 Royal London Cup campaign, and showed signs of greater consistency the following summer when he averaged 43.00 in the Bob Willis Trophy.But his form in the Blast - first as a finisher in 2020, then shifting up to No. 4 in 2021 - was enough for him to be touted as a future England player, and an innings of 62 from 31 balls in the Northern Superchargers' first Hundred game led Stokes to echo that sentiment. He is particularly strong against seamers, hitting down the ground, or over midwicket and the covers, and has become innovative too, reverse-lapping and scooping in the death overs.Brook, an orderly young batsman, won 1st XI recognition midway through 2017 courtesy of an impressive run of scores in the second team, the highlight of which was a matchwinning century in a one-day final against Middlesex at Headingley. A product of the Burley-in-Wharfedale club, and Sedburgh School, Brook had already toured India with England Under-19s at that stage and he captained them later in the year in 50-over cricket in the return series against the Indians.He led from the front, initially at least, at the 2018 U19 World Cup, where he finished as England's leading run-scorer. But he made a golden duck in the quarter-final defeat to Australia and was then dropped for their final game, a seventh-place play-off against New Zealand, for disciplinary reasons.\nESPNcricinfo staff",

He led the country to their first appearance in an Under-19 World Cup semi-final in February 2016, before making the year more memorable with his Test debut, against England in October.He is a batting allrounder who bowls right-arm offspin with a quiet action where he trundles to the wicket before giving a slight leap before rotating his upper body. It is a beautifully simple action that has yielded him many wickets in the U-19 and first-class level.Born in Barisal, Mehedi grew up in Daulatpur in the outskirts of Khulna city. He learned offspin from Sheikh Salahuddin, the former Bangladesh player regarded as the best offspinner of his generation. Salahuddin passed away in October 2013. Mehedi spent two years at the U-19 level, captaining Bangladesh to the 2014 World Cup in the UAE.

It took him another three years to break into the senior side, but when he did, he made an impact right away with 97, 143 and 125 in his first three Tests, at home against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. He did well against tougher opposition as well, making 94 in a comprehensive win over India in Centurion in January 2018 and two big hundreds against Australia in the contentious Sandpapergate series two months later. But overseas success took a while to come - after disappointing tours of India and Sri Lanka, Markram made his first away Test hundred in a second-innings effort in Rawalpindi in February 2021, showing he had the technique to navigate pitches that turned and stayed low. His 108 gave South Africa a fighting chance, but they eventually lost the series 2-0. A batter of class and composure, aggressive and strong on the off side, Markram did well in limited-overs cricket as well.

    "playingRole": "Top order Batter",
    "description": "That Joe Root would one day captain England was taken as read when he hit the grand old age of 23. The accolade everybody anticipated became his three years later, when Alastair Cook stood down after the 2016-17 tour of India. It was understandable that there were a few fears for Root's future workload. He was rare among England batsmen in achieving maturity so quickly, and had looked consumed by the delights of batting from the moment he first took guard. Now he had new responsibilities. Slight of build, perky of shot and with a scampish grin that got under a bowler's skin, by the time Root was appointed Test captain he had rattled up 53 Tests within five years with an average top side of 50, comfortably the highest among contemporary England players. Early expectations that he would establish himself as an opener did not materialise as an expansive game increasingly seemed better suited to No. 3 or No. 4. He was equally influential in limited-overs cricket where England's commitment to fearless cricket after their 2015 World Cup was much to his tastes, his crispness of stroke and shrewd judgment enabling him to bat purposefully around batsmen of greater weight of shot.Root had never been a strikingly heavy scorer as he worked through the ranks, nor was he particularly athletic, but his systematic approach was that of a young batsman who would not sell his wicket easily and gave England hope that he would be able to attune his game to the highest level. A slender batsman reliant on precision, his patience and stubbornness at the crease had Geoffrey Boycott gushing that he reminded him of himself, although Root soon developed a much broader range. Others saw some of his mentor Michael Vaughan in Root's front-foot drive - the pair also both attended Sheffield Collegiate.Root's Test debut for England in Nagpur in 2012 exemplified the qualities which had attracted coaches from an early age. Picked to tour India on the strength of two encouraging seasons with Yorkshire - and having been named Cricket Writers' Club Young Player of the Year - he impressed enough to be selected for the final Test of the series. He began with England's sixth-longest debut innings in terms of balls faced, scoring 73 from 229 balls as he displayed the patience and discrimination demanded both by the situation of the game and a desperately slow surface. His rise continued with a maiden Test hundred in his home ground, Headingley, against New Zealand in 2013 followed by a maiden Ashes century at Lord's having been promoted to open. Root looked set to occupy that role for many years to come, but his fortunes dipped as the series went on and then crashed along with the team as England were whitewashed in Australia in 2013-14. He began the tour at No. 6, moved up to No. 3 after the enforced departure of Jonathan Trott, then saw his Ashes ended early when he was dropped for the fifth Test in Sydney.Proof of Root's ability came in the way he responded. Back in England, he followed up a two-tone double hundred against Sri Lanka at Lord's - a disciplined innings with a freewheeling finale - with two more big hundreds against India. All three had the not-out asterisk. That seemed to say a lot about him.He even had the fortune to skipper Yorkshire to the Championship title at Trent Bridge in 2014 when Andrew Gale was suspended, less than a fortnight after he became the first Yorkshire batsman to hit an ODI hundred at Headingley, with India the victims. He was also in charge for Yorkshire's thumping defeat at Middlesex, in which they chased down 472 in the fourth innings. To his amusement, his team-mates dubbed him \"Craptain\". His full potential then poured forth in 2015 when he made 1385 Test runs in the year, and vied with Australia's Steven Smith at the top of the ICC Test rankings. Root played with alacrity on all surfaces and in all formats and his obvious delight in his art was a positive symbol in an England side committed in all formats to a more enterprising approach. Jaunty Ashes hundreds at Cardiff and Nottingham helped England to victories, his consistency at No. 4 repeatedly masked top-order frailties, and a mischievous sense of humour made his success all the more pleasurable.As England fell to defeat against Pakistan in the UAE in late 2015, a pattern began to build up which piqued Root even as he confirmed himself as one of the best batsmen around: his world became rather too full of entertaining 70s and 80s when he felt that a big hundred was there for the taking. Between his hundred in Johannesburg in early 2016 on a triumphant England tour and a century in Rajkot as England slumped 4-0 to India, he passed 50 six times but only converted one into a hundred. There again, it was quite a hundred: a career-best 254 against Pakistan at Old Trafford that banished talk of premature burnout in a non-stop England programme.Firmly established among the modern game's \"Big Four\" batsmen (Root, Smith, Virat Kohli and Kane Williamson), these were years of easy scoring. In 2015 and 2016 he set consecutive records for runs accumulated across all formats in a calendar year for England, with 2228 and 2570 respectively; in 2017, he came within five runs of surpassing Vaughan's calendar high-water mark of 1481 for England in Tests, which had stood since 2002. The following summer, with back-to-back efforts against India, Root surpassed Marcus Trescothick's English record of 12 ODI hundreds.Problems of conversion returned to afflict him in his second year as Test captain, however. Having made a matchwinning 190 against South Africa at Lord's, in his first match in charge, and a century in England's first day-night Test, against West Indies at Edgbaston, he went more than a year before again reaching three figures in a Test. That period included another unsuccessful Ashes tour of Australia, where Root topped the England averages but could only manage a highest score of 83. Defeat in New Zealand followed, then a messy draw at home to Pakistan, before England rallied to beat No. 1 side India 4-1 and give Root encouragement in his plans to rebuild the Test side.\nESPNcricinfo staff\n",

Before he had turned 21, Rabada had already established himself as a potential leader of the attack. Rabada thrust himself into the international spotlight at the 2014 Under-19 World Cup, where he took 6 for 25 against Australia in the semi-final. South Africa went on to win the title - their first - and Rabada finished as their highest wicket-taker.  Three months later, he was awarded a franchise contract with Lions and before the year was up, he had been included in the national ODI and Test squads. He made his T20I debut against Australia in Adelaide in November 2014.  In early 2015, Rabada showed his ability in the longer format. He claimed the South African record for the best bowling figures in a first-class match, 14 for 105, surpassing the haul taken by Dale Steyn seven seasons before. He finished the season as the third-highest wicket-taker in the Sunfoil Series. He was included in all three squads to tour Bangladesh in July-August 2015, and became only the second player to take a hat-trick on ODI debut, eventually finishing with the best figures by a first-timer: 6 for 16. Rabada also played in a home series against New Zealand and was then included on a tour to India. There, he led the ODI wicket-takers' list with Steyn after both claimed 10 wickets. Injuries to Morne Morkel, then Steyn and Vernon Philander, meant Rabada got a chance to play in three of the four Tests of that series. On inhospitable pitches, he worked hard, often without reward but displayed the stamina required of a Test bowler. Rabada has had more assistance from the surfaces at home, where he played against England in the absence of Steyn and Philander. In the final Test, with South Africa having already lost the series, Rabada became the youngest South African to take 10 wickets in a match when he finished with 13 for 144. His workload did not lessen as he played a further four ODIs and two T20Is against England, three T20Is against Australia, and also led the attack at the 2016 World T20 in India. After his performances, Rabada seemed primed for an IPL stint but chose to sign a county deal with Kent for a month instead.  Firdose Moonda",

Mahmud is still at a very early stage of his career, having just played a single T20I for Bangladesh, and earned a maiden call-up in the ODI side in January 2021, but already he has earned plenty of praise from Bangladesh's coaches for his ability to bowl fast, full and accurately. Mahmud is also one of the rarities in Bangladesh cricket, in that he is also a very good outfielder among the pace bowlers. He is not very tall, but with an action that is mostly front-on, he generates enough pace to beat the bat. During the Bangabandhu T20 Cup in November 2020, Mahmud took eleven wickets for eventual champions Gemcon Khulna, which got him the ODI call-up against West Indies.He mainly emerged from the BCB's age-group structure, having first played for the Chattogram Under-16s in 2015, since he is from Laxmipur, a district within the Chattogram Division. He developed for three years in the system, culminating in his nine wickets in the 2018 Under-19 World Cup.He quickly followed it up with 12 wickets in the Dhaka Premier League (List-A) and continued to play for the Under-23 side. In the 2019-20 season, he took ten wickets each in the BPL (T20s) and Bangladesh Cricket League (first-class) competitions, before making his T20I debut against Zimbabwe in March 2020.Mohammad Isam\n",

    "description": "- David Miller was for the longest time the face of Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings, or PBKS) after being brought in as a replacement player in IPL 2011 for US$ 100,000. He did not get a game that season but was retained by the franchise for IPL 2012 and stayed there till the end of the 2019 season.- Leading into IPL 2024, Miller sat third on the list for most runs for PBKS (and KXIP), and only Piyush Chawla (87) had played more games for Kings than Miller's 82.- In 2013 he smashed an unbeaten 38-ball 101 to help Kings chase down a target of 191 against RCB. He was named captain of the franchise ahead of IPL 2016 but was removed six games into the season after the team had a poor start.- Miller played two seasons with Rajasthan Royals in IPL 2020 and 2021 before being picked up by Gujarat Titans at the IPL 2022 mega auction.- Miller has breached the 350-run mark four times in the IPL. The 2022 edition was his best where he scored 481 runs in 16 matches at 68.71 - a key reason behind Titans lifting the IPL trophy in that their debut season.A hard-hitting left-hander with a penchant for clearing the boundary, David Miller made famous the phrase \"If it's in the arc, it's out the park.\" Miller is a self-styled finisher who is strong off the front and back foot and eager to swing his arms, as well as a gun fielder. He made his first-class debut in 2008 at the age of at 18 and two years later, his international debut on South Africa's tour of West Indies. But it was only in 2013 that he became a regular at international level and it took another two years for him to get his first ODI century: 130 against West Indies in January 2015, followed swiftly by an unbeaten 138 two matches later, which sent him to the World Cup in good form. He made an 18-ball 49 in the semi-final that South Africa narrowly lost to New Zealand. Miller spent even longer waiting for a milestone in T20I cricket. His first fifty in the format came in March 2016. Both speak more to lack of opportunity in limited-overs cricket, rather than lack of ability. At the IPL, Miller was one of the mainstays of Kings XI Punjab for eight years, scoring over 350 runs in each season between 2013 and 2015 and captaining them in 2016. In 2022, he had his best IPL season, scoring 481 runs and striking at 142.72 in Gujarat Titans' title-winning campaign. \n",

Karunaratne made his first class debut for Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC) in 2008, but had a quiet first season, batting largely in the middle order. He secured a place in the top order in 2009, and began to score more consistently thereafter. His maiden first-class century, against Colts Cricket Club, heralded a deluge of 1186 runs in the season, at an average of 56.54. His prolific form earnt him a call-up for the Sri Lanka A team against visiting South Africa A, where he again impressed, making 184 against an attack that included Vernon Philander. Karunaratne has not reproduced the same volume of runs since his second season, but has developed a reputation for making big centuries against good attacks. He played two ODIs for Sri Lanka in 2011, making 4 and 60, and was also included in the Test tour to South Africa later in the year, though he did not get a game. He toured South Africa again in July 2012 though, with the A team, and impressed with scores of 83 and 150 not out on that tour. Soon after that, he found himself on the verge of a Test debut when he was chosen to open alongside SSC partner Tharanga Paranavitana, replacing the injured Tillakaratne Dilshan for the Test against New Zealand in Galle.Andrew Fernando",

    "description": "Allrounder, and Twitter star, Jimmy Neesham went from the brink of retirement from cricket to almost delivering New Zealand the 2019 World Cup. In the tournament he was outstanding with bat and ball then in the final against England claimed three wickets and produced the final-ball run out to tie the scores after 50 overs. He was entrusted with the bat in the Super Over and scored 13 off 5 balls including a huge six off Jofra Archer. He was at the non-striker's end for the last ball when Martin Guptill was run out coming back for a second run that would have won New Zealand the World Cup. He made his international debut in a Twenty20 international on New Zealand's tour to South Africa in 2012-13, following some impressive performances in the shorter formats in the domestic season. Neesham began his first-class career with Auckland, but a move Otago worked well for him, as he made some important contributions in the 50-over format in the 2011-12 season, making three 40-plus scores in seven innings, all of them coming at more than a run a ball. He was among the wickets too, taking a career-best 5 for 44 against Wellington and 4 for 23 against Canterbury. The rewards came soon, as he was included in the limited-overs squads for the tour to South Africa and made his T20I and ODI debuts. In February 2014, Neesham made a century on Test debut against India and was at the other end when skipper Brendon McCullum became the first Black Cap to score a Test triple century. He became just the eighth player in Test history to score hundreds in his first two Tests when he made a century against West Indies in Jamaica.He narrowly missed the cut for the home World Cup in 2015, an experience he described as \"gut-wrenching\", when Grant Elliott was preferred at the last minute. Neesham found himself in the stands at Eden Park as Elliott struck that iconic six against South Africa to secure a spot in the final.Neesham was part of the one-day side over the next two seasons but was dropped after the 2017 Champions Trophy. He was ready to retire but was talked out of it and asked instead to take a break from the game. He returned in 2018 and dominated domestic one-day cricket scoring 503 runs at an average of 62.87 with a strike rate of 110.79, which earned him an international recall to face Sri Lanka. He made 47 not out from 13 balls and 64 from 37 in his first two ODIs back in January 2019 and locked up his 2019 World Cup spot.\nESPNcricinfo staff",

    "description": "When the annals of Bangladesh cricket are sifted by future generations, Shakib Al Hasan will emerge and re-emerge as the greatest cricketer of its first two decades. As a bowler, Shakib is accurate, consistent and canny; aggression and a wide range of strokes are the keys to his batting. Even more importantly, he has self-belief and an excellent temperament, unflustered by the big occasion and ready to do battle against the top teams.The best of his ability and temperament were on display in his first Test as captain, against a weakened West Indies side in Grenada, when Shakib took eight wickets and scored an unbeaten 96 in a tense but successful fourth-innings chase of 215, leading Bangladesh to their first overseas series victory. In only his fourth Test as captain, Shakib scored 87 and 100 - his maiden Test century - in a losing cause against New Zealand in Hamilton, performances that offered further proof of his skill and ability to handle pressure. Against the same opponents in 2008, Shakib took 7 for 36 in Chittagong, only the second instance of a Bangladesh bowler taking seven or more wickets in a Test innings.In ODIs, Shakib's contributions have been equally vital with bat and ball and he became the first from Bangladesh to achieve the double of 2000 runs and 100 wickets. He also became the first batsman from Bangladesh to score five hundreds, despite mostly batting at No. 5.Being clearly the best player in the team, it wasn't surprising when Shakib was handed the captaincy in 2009 after Mashrafe Mortaza repeatedly got injured during his first tenure. His ability to perform consistently and to stay calm under pressure worked well for Bangladesh, as they won 22 out of 47 games under him, and even beat England in the 2011 World Cup. However, the World Cup campaign was followed by a disappointing tour of Zimbabwe, where Bangladesh lost a one-off Test and the ODI series, which led to Shakib's removal as captain.His form hardly waned, however, as he quickly bounced back to help Bangladesh bowl out West Indies for 61 in an ODI; a hundred and five-for in the same Test - something he has done twice - followed later in the year. He remained consistent for Bangladesh and his IPL team, Kolkata Knight Riders, but in 2014 Shakib lapsed into off-field shenanigans that saw him fined for lewdly gesticulating at the camera from the dressing-room during an ODI against Sri Lanka, then suspended for six months by the BCB for misbehaving with coach Chandika Hathurusingha and threatening to quit Bangladesh duty. The ban was lifted early and Shakib made the vice-captain in the ODI and T20 formats under Mashrafe. His match-winning ability was undimmed and he played key roles in Bangladesh wins during their stellar 2015. In the 2019 World Cup, Shakib hit his peak with the bat: playing the No. 3 role, he went past fifty in seven out of eight innings, with a lowest score of 41. That streak included two centuries, including an unbeaten 124 off 99 balls as Bangladesh chased down West Indies' 321 inside 42 overs - a record ODI chase for the country. Shakib finished the tournament third on the batting charts with 606 runs at 86.57, and also took a five-wicket haul against Afghanistan. The highs from that World Cup would dissolve shortly after. Shakib was suspended from all cricket for two years, with one year suspended, after accepting three charges of breaching the ICC's anti-corruption code. He was found guilty of not reporting approaches from bookies during series with Bangladesh as well as at the IPL during his time with the Sunrisers Hyderabad. The suspension would have effectively ended his chances of participating in the T20 World Cup in 2020, but the Covid-19 pandemic meant the tournament was postponed, and that a large part of Shakib's suspension went by without his missing too much cricket with the national team. Shakib was back in the set up soon after, and said he regretted and repented his actions, and that the suspension and the pandemic had made him rethink life.In 2021, he had another run-in with the authorities. This time, during the Dhaka Premier League. Playing for Mohammedan Sporting Club against Abahani Limited, Shakib was caught on video first kicking the stumps and remonstrating with the umpire after his lbw appeal had been turned down, and later ripping them out in anger after the umpire called for the covers when it had begun to rain. He was subsequently banned for three matches and fined Taka 5 lakh (USD 5800 approx).Mohammad Isam & ESPNcricinfo staff",

Batting at No. 4 in an AIA Premier T20 match against Saracens Sports Club, Shanaka struck a Sri Lankan record 16 sixes in an innings worth 123 from 46 balls. That wasn't even his biggest T20 score of the last week. He had hit 131 off 48 balls against Galle Cricket Club one week earlier.But it was with the ball that Shanaka first made his mark on the international stage.

Shadab is not afraid of bowling the wrong'un either; his only criticism might be that he bowls it a bit too often, but that hasn't helped batsmen pick it up any better, either out of the hand or off the pitch. He's also a useful lower-order right-handed batsman, something that has occasionally been witnessed during his domestic career.Shadab has made an immediate impact; he only played his maiden first-class game ten months ago, in July 2016. His ability with the U-19 side caught PSL franchise Islamabad United's eye, who gave the young leggie a chance he accepted with aplomb. His performance during the competition won him praise from the likes of Wasim Akram and Misbah-ul-Haq, and saw him called up to Pakistan's limited-overs side for the tour to the West Indies.

He bowls with a high-arm action, after coming in from a smooth run-up. He is a product of Dhaka's cricket academy scene, having learned his craft at the Abahani ground nets, living nearby in Mohammadpur.He burst into the domestic scene with a four-wicket haul in the 2013 BPL, but he suffered a knee injury soon after which kept him sidelined for nearly a year. He went through rehabilitation work during the time, and as he slowly recovered, Taskin bowled in the Bangladesh nets regularly.The coaching staff was impressed by his ability, and kept him in the radar for a very long time, until they found the right time to blood him.

His first season was for Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) after which he was part of Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in 2014 and 2015. He rejoined RCB in 2016, missed IPL 2017 because of injury, and then represented Punjab Kings (PBKS, previously known as Kings XI Punjab or KXIP) from 2018 to 2021. Rahul moved to Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in IPL 2022.- A versatile batter who started in the middle order before moving to the top, Rahul also keeps wicket in the IPL, and has emerged as one of the league's most consistent run-scorers, with more than 590 runs in each season from 2018 to 2022.- In IPL 2018, Rahul smashed a fifty off 14 balls against Delhi Daredevils, which was the record for the fastest half-century in the IPL at the time.- In IPL 2020, Rahul won the Orange Cap for the most runs in the season: 670.- Rahul was named captain of Punjab Kings in IPL 2020 - his first captaincy stint in the IPL - and he led them for two years before moving to LSG, where he was appointed captain once again. Under Rahul's leadership, LSG qualified for the playoffs in their first two IPL seasons, though Rahul played only nine matches in IPL 2023 because of a thigh injury.- With four centuries, ahead of IPL 2024 Rahul is second only to Virat Kohli among Indian batters with the most hundreds in the Indian Premier League.A tall, elegant right-hand batter who can keep wicket in a crisis, KL Rahul is among the most highly rated opening batters in India's next generation. Rahul was a part of India's squad in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup and made his first-class debut later that year. Having taken a while to establish himself as a first-class cricketer, he enjoyed a breakthrough 2013-14 season, laying the foundation for Karnataka's Ranji Trophy victory with 1033 runs, which included three centuries, three nineties, and a Man-of-the-Match performance in the final.Rahul attracted plenty of attention at the subsequent IPL auction, and finally went to Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs. 1 crore (US$ 166,000 approx.). He was a regular member of their side in the 2014 season, mostly as wicketkeeper-batter, but his contributions with the bat were steady rather than spectacular.In the long format, however, his technique and application have impressed some of Indian cricket's most respected names. These include Rahul Dravid, with whom Rahul shares not just a name but also a strong rapport, regularly seeking him out for technical and mental advice.Rahul had a middling tour of Australia with the India A team in July-August 2014, getting starts each time he batted in the unofficial Tests but only managing a top score of 52. But his appetite for runs was back to normal by the time the 2014-15 domestic season began, and twin centuries in the Duleep Trophy final earned him a place in India's Test squad on their tour of Australia.A profitable IPL in 2016 set him up to make the Indian ODI and T20 squad that toured Zimbabwe in June, where he became the first batter from his country to score a century on debut in 50-over cricket.Karthik Krishnaswamy\n",

He has won the Orange Cap only once - in 2016 - Kohli captained RCB full-time from 2013 to 2021 and led them to the final in the 2016 season, when they lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad - Kohli holds the record for the most prolific partnerships in the IPL, with AB de Villiers (3123 runs) and Chris Gayle (2787 runs) - His popularity has made RCB one of the most followed teams in the IPL, even though they haven't yet won a titleIndia has given to the world many a great cricketer but perhaps none as ambitious as Virat Kohli. To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty of them.This ambition transferred seamlessly to his captaincy: he demanded more than ever of his bowlers especially the quick ones, often sacrificed a batsman for bowling depth, and led India to a long stay at No. 1 in Test rankings and a first-ever series win in Australia. He is well on his way to end up as India's most successful Test captain.  Barring one in Bangladesh, Kohli scored Test hundreds in and against every country he played. He absolutely smashed records for number of matches taken to reach eight, nine, ten and eleven thousand ODI runs, and became the first batter to score 50 hundreds in one-day internationals.An Under-19 world Cup-winning captain, when he burst onto the scene, Kohli was a precocious talent with a cover drive to kill for. He was destined to be India's next big batsman as the Tendulkar era began to retire, but Kohli wanted to be more: a cricketer whom the opposition would be in awe of, a cricketer whose presence would raise the intensity of the contest. He lived every ball, competed each moment, and made sure he had the fitness and strength to do so. He was widely credited for changing the fitness culture in Indian cricket, introducing endurance tests as a criterion for selection. Kohli was quite simply India's most powerful captain. Centre of every marketing campaign for Indian cricket, he also happened to lead at a time when the BCCI was run by interim administrators who knew better than to draw the ire of Indian cricket's biggest star. There was never any cause to doubt his intent: to do things that will win matches for India, which they did plenty under him.\n",

    "description": "- Ravindra Jadeja has won the IPL final four times, once with Rajasthan Royals (RR) and three times with Chennai Super Kings (CSK).- He was the Player of the Match in CSK's thrilling win in 2023 when he hit a four off the last ball of the match.- The late Shane Warne marked him out as a future superstar when he captained the 19-year-old Jadeja in 2008, nicknaming him \"Rockstar\".- Jadeja is CSK's second-highest wicket-taker (125) in the IPL, behind only Dwayne Bravo (140).- He was handed the CSK captaincy in 2022, but stepped down mid-season and MS Dhoni took the reins again. CSK finished joint-bottom of the table that year.- Jadeja holds the record for scoring most runs in an over in the IPL: he took 36 off RCB's Harshal Patel in a seven-ball over in 2021. The over went for 37 in all.Dissed when he first appeared, Ravindra Jadeja won the doubters and haters over with his deeds, and now sits among the elite of Indian spin bowling.In October 2019 he became the quickest left-arm bowler to reach 200 Test wickets. Six years before that, he had became the first Indian since Anil Kumble in 1993 to top the ICC ODI bowling rankings. In the IPL, he drew a scarcely believable bid of US$2 million in 2012. In an era in which he was bound to be overshadowed by the artistry of fellow spinner R Ashwin, Jadeja kept his senior colleague on his toes, and often stole the spot when conditions allowed India to play just the one spinner. It helped that he was a captain's dream: arguably the fastest man on the turf and the best fielder in the time that he played, he went on to become an important lower-order batter. Some of his best batting performances came against the top teams, and they were often accompanied by the swordsman's celebration that became his signature. Ten years into his career, he had five Test fifties and a hundred against England - the latter in a partnership of 222 with Rishabh Pant at Edgbaston in 2022 - and four half-centuries against Australia. It was all a far cry from the memes his batting inspired at the start of his career - though the ridicule directed at his three triple-hundreds in domestic cricket back then was more an indictment of the quality of bowling on the Indian first-class circuit at the time. Jadeja shone in India's 2013 Champions Trophy win, finishing as the leading wicket-taker, with 12 wickets, two of those in the final, where he also made an unbeaten 33.His most valuable assets as a bowler are perhaps his fitness and strength, which enable him to go at batters for hours, ready to pounce on any assistance from the pitch. Like with his batting, his bowling highlights too feature the best sides disproportionately. His first Test five-for came against Australia in Delhi in 2013, and was followed by 6 for 138 in his next match, against South Africa in Durban, though that was in an India defeat. When South Africa next visited India, he got stuck into them, with 23 wickets in the four Tests in 2015. Against England at home in 2016-17, he harvested 26; this included an impressive demolition job in Chennai, where he took 7 for 48 after India had racked up 759 runs. Later that season he took 25 wickets when Australia visited for four Tests, to go with the 24 from the previous time, in 2013. Through the first half of his career and beyond, Jadeja's place in the Test side was never quite secure. He had to fight through a serious shoulder injury, and he was even dropped from the squad, but he kept coming back. Of course, these hardships paled in comparison with a tough childhood in Jamnagar, and the hard knocks that marked his early career, including being banned by the IPL for a year for essentially trying to negotiate his salary. In that tournament, Jadeja has been synonymous with Chennai Super Kings, for whom he has taken over 100 wickets over nine seasons and whom he briefly captained in 2022.\n",

He is their second-highest wicket-taker after Lasith Malinga.- Bumrah is coming into IPL 2024 after a successful recovery from a back injury that forced him to miss the 2023 season.- Bumrah was spotted by MI after just one season of domestic T20 cricket and signed as an uncapped player ahead of IPL 2013. He played just two matches in his debut season and his first IPL wicket was that of Virat Kohli. His 100th IPL wicket, in IPL 2020, was also that of Kohli.- Since 2014, Bumrah has been a key part of the MI bowling unit and has grown to become its undisputed leader. With his unique action and high pace, Bumrah possesses a bagful of variations and a lethally accurate yorker, and is a force in every stage of the game.- Bumrah was MI's highest wicket-taker in three of their IPL title wins, taking 20 wickets in 2017, 19 in 2019, and 27 in 2020. He was also part of the squad when Mumbai won titles in 2013 and 2015, though he didn't play many games because he was new in 2013 and injured in 2015.Jasprit Bumrah grabbed eyeballs first with his unorthodox action, and then his bowling skills. Armed with an anomalous, sling-arm action and natural pace, the peculiar release point of Bumrah's deliveries makes it hard for batsmen to pick him. Besides, like his Mumbai Indians team-mate, Lasith Malinga, Bumrah carved himself a reputation for possessing an uncanny ability to hit the blockhole. And, it was during his time in the IPL that he learned from the Sri Lankan to judiciously use the yorker.  A regular member of the India A team, Bumrah was on the fringes of national selection before a debilitating left knee injury at the end of 2014 kept him out for four-and-a-half months. He had to wait more than a year before earning another call-up, one which came on the back of a fruitful 2015-16 domestic season, where he was Gujarat's second-highest wicket-taker in the Ranji Trophy and topped the bowling charts in the Vijay Hazare Trophy - that included a five-for in the List-A final that gave Gujarat their maiden one-day title. Those performances, and an untimely injury to Mohammed Shami, meant Bumrah took the flight to Australia, where he played a central role for India, finishing as the highest wicket-taker from either side as the visitors swept the T20Is 3-0. It was a showing that earned him the praise of MS Dhoni - who called him the find of the tour - as well as a place in India's squad for the 2016 World T20.ESPNcricinfo staff ",

    "description": "- Rohit Sharma has won six IPL titles: one with Deccan Chargers and five as captain of Mumbai Indians (MI), making him the joint most successful captain in the Indian Premier League.- He joined Mumbai in 2011 and became captain in 2013. He took them to their maiden IPL title in his first season as captain and went on to lead MI for 11 years before he was replaced by Hardik Pandya for the 2024 season.- Rohit is MI's top-scorer and one of only four batters with more than 6000 runs in the IPL. His only hundred - 109* against Kolkata Knight Riders - came in IPL 2012.- Rohit's best IPL season with the bat was in 2013, when he scored 538 runs in MI's title-winning campaign. In 2015, Rohit was the Player of the Final as Mumbai beat Chennai Super Kings to win their second IPL title. MI went on to win the IPL in 2017, 2019 and 2020 under Rohit's leadershipLanguid and easy on the eye, Rohit Sharma owned all the shots in the book when he emerged from the Mumbai suburbs as heir apparent to the Indian batting greats of the 2000s. It took him time and persistence, but by the 2010s he had become a colossus in white-ball cricket, and the man in charge of perhaps the most formidable league team in the first age of T20.That Rohit had talent was apparent to both the casual observer and to the trained eye. Fans were frustrated at the long wait for the potential to translate into runs, though selectors and captains, knowing better, kept backing him. At one point the word \"talent\" was Rohit's bugbear, a pejorative nickname for him on social media. Once it all clicked, though - the move to open the batting in ODIs late in 2012 was one particular turning point - things came together spectacularly.Rohit scored ODI double-hundreds for fun, won six IPLs in the first 15 editions of the tournament, scored five hundreds at the 2019 ODI World Cup, and when he finally got to open in Tests in 2019, three quick hundreds in his first series in the role, one of them a double. Ironically his IPL franchise nicknamed him \"Hitman\" when he was anything but: more caresser, less hitter. But Rohit still became known as one of the foremost hitters of colossal sixes of his era. So spectacular and certain was his acceleration that people began anticipate a massive score every time he went past 50.His captaincy at Mumbai Indians, whom he led to five titles, won plaudits. He proved himself a methodical, studious and calm leader, one not averse to using technology and data to arrive at decisions. He was an able deputy to Virat Kohli in limited-overs formats in international cricket, winning India two titles in Kohli's absence, and took over as captain in all formats in 2022.",

    "description": "Moeen Ali was tipped for the top long before he won his Test debut at the start of 2014. But, after building a reputation as an elegant batter, it was his offspin bowling that earned him the call-up when England were left reeling from the surprise retirement of Graeme Swann.While many critics dismissed him as a \"part-time\" bowler, Moeen had a record to compare with the best in county cricket over recent seasons. And while he suffered more than his share of ups and downs, for the next five years he manfully carried the load in one of the most under-resourced areas of the English game. When he was dropped during the 2019 Ashes, subsequently losing his central contract, it turned out to be the beginning of the end for Moeen as a Test allrounder; nevertheless, on calling time in 2021, he finished just shy of 3000 Test runs and 200 wickets, making him England's third most-prolific spinner of all time.He was also a 50-over World Cup winner, as well as a regular at the IPL - his flair for fast scoring and utility as an allrounder encouraging the decision to focus solely on white-ball cricket ahead of the T20 World Cup in the UAE. Moeen admitted that he felt his batting had been \"wasted\" in Test cricket, where he featured everywhere from No. 1 to No. 9, but there will still moments to treasure, from an unbeaten hundred in his second Test to four centuries in the calendar year in 2016.He also managed a Test hat-trick, against South Africa at The Oval in 2017, during a series in which he took 25 wickets and scored 252 runs, and played a significant part in England winning the 2015 Ashes, as well as the 3-0 whitewash of Sri Lanka in 2018-19. A measure of his abilities as a Test bowler were his six dismissals of Virat Kohli - the last of which, in what turned out to be Moeen's final match, took him past Jim Laker's 193 Test dismissals.It was his batting that stood out during his early Test appearances. His outstanding 108 not out, spread over 6-and-a-half hours and 281 balls, against Sri Lanka at Headingley took England to within two balls of saving the series but, while he did unveil the first doosra bowled by an Englishman in a Test - developed after consulting Saeed Ajmal at Worcestershire - he initially struggled to offer his captain the requisite control in the field with his bowling.That changed in training for the Lord's Test against India. Encouraged by team-mate Ian Bell over the need to bowl quicker to survive in international cricket, Moeen benefited from a chance conversation from former Test offspinner Kumar Dharmasena, an umpire in the series and an onlooker at an England training session, who provided technical advice as to how to achieve the extra pace without losing any flight. It was to prove a pivotal meeting. Moeen was tighter at Lord's, devastating in Southampton and excellent at Old Trafford as he finished the series with 19 wickets; the fourth-highest haul any spinner had claimed against India in a Test series outside the subcontinent.Moeen had already made ODI and T20I debuts in the West Indies, before playing all four of England's games at the 2014 World T20. And while he struggled to recapture his batting form after that maiden century in Tests, he took his chance when promoted to the top of the order in the ODI side by hitting a 72-ball century in Colombo and ended the year a regular in all formats.Part of the team that failed abysmally at the 2015 World Cup, Moeen was also a key member of the revolution under Eoin Morgan, usually batting at No. 7 - from where he thrashed a 53-ball hundred against West Indies in 2017 - and providing spin back-up to his friend Adil Rashid. His captaincy skills also came to the fore, helping Worcestershire to secure a maiden T20 title and guiding Birmingham Phoenix into the final of the inaugural Hundred. In 2020, he became the first British Asian to captain England in a T20I.He had looked destined for such success for some time. Signed by Warwickshire as a 15-year-old, he made a century on first-class debut against Cambridge MCCU (he remains the second-youngest man to score a first-class half-century for the club) and Championship debut against Nottinghamshire but was dropped for the next game on both occasions. He also captained England Under-19s to the semi-final of the 2006 World Cup, blasted a 56-ball century in an U19 Test against Sri Lanka and, as a 14-year-old, smashed 195 not out in a Twenty20 match for his under-15 club side Moseley Ashfield. The next highest score was 11.But, frustrated by a lack of opportunity at Warwickshire during Mark Greatbatch's ill-fated reign as coach of the club, he left for local rivals Worcestershire at the end of 2006 and was a key part of the team that won the Pro-40 title in 2007. It included a 46-ball century against Northants in 2007; there had, at the time, been only one faster List A century made in England in matches involving two first-class counties.There were setbacks. Trying to combat a tendency to nick off, he went through a period of batting like Shivnarine Chanderpaul and then a spell of leaving balls that hit his off stump instead. But he made 1270 runs in 2010 and 1375 runs in 2013 - the year he won the PCA's Most Valuable Player award - as he augmented his flair with increased discipline. All the while, his offspin continued to improve.Moeen's development had a significance beyond the playing field. Taking on the mantle of role model for fellow British Asians - a sector of society that county cricket has not always encouraged as it might have done - he also talked eloquently of his Muslim faith and grew perhaps the most noticeable beard in English cricket since the days of WG Grace. He became known fondly as \"the beard that's feared\" at New Road.George Dobell",

He top-scored for KKR in 2020 (440 runs) and once again in their run to the IPL final in 2021 (478 runs), but was not retained by KKR after the 2021 season.A right-hand top-order batsman from Punjab, Shubman Gill is known for his penchant for big runs and was hence drafted into India Under-19 side as the vice-captain for the 2018 World Cup.

In 2014, he smacked 351 in Punjab's Inter-District Under-16 tournament, and shared a record opening stand of 587 with Nirmal Singh. On his Under-16 state debut for Punjab, he made an unbeaten double-century in the Vijay Merchant Trophy. Later that year, he went on to share the stage with his idol Virat Kohli while receiving a BCCI award for the best junior cricketer, which he won for two successive years: 2013-14 and 2014-15.When picked for the national Under-19 side, he amassed 351 runs in four innings to be named the Man of the Series during the Youth ODI series at home against England. In the reciprocal tour, his first in English conditions, he top-scored once more, with 278 runs in four innings. India swept both series.\nWhile he was still in New Zealand for the World Cup on the day of the 2018 IPL auction, Gill was picked by Kolkata Knight Riders for INR 1.8 crore (USD 281,000 approx).",

    "description": "- Having made his IPL debut for Mumbai Indians (MI) in 2016, Buttler has become one of the most destructive batters in the tournament over the years.- Buttler was part of Mumbai Indians' title-winning side in 2017 before being signed by Rajasthan Royals (RR) in 2018/- A move up the order unlocked his best. No opener - who has faced at least 1000 balls - has scored quicker than at Buttler's 146.65 since the 2020 season.- In IPL 2022, Buttler equalled Virat Kohli's record of four centuries in a season. And only Kohli (973) and Shubman Gill (890) have scored more runs in a season than his 863 in 2022.- In 2018, Buttler became only the second player after Virender Sehwag to hit five consecutive 50-plus scores in the IPL. David Warner joined the list in 2019.- Buttler started the 2024 season with 2696 runs already for RR, and is their third-highest run-scorer of all time.England have had many players down the ages who have gained world acclaim, but Jos Buttler is arguably their first global Twenty20 superstar. Buttler helped bring England's limited-overs batting into the 21st century, his impact on the one-day and T20 sides extraordinary as they turned a group-stage exit in the 2015 World Cup into a triumph on home soil four years later, with his efforts with the bat and the gloves crucial to their Super-Over victory in the final. In an 18-month period from mid-2014, he scored what at the time were England's three fastest one-day hundreds - thrilling innings against Sri Lanka at Lord's, New Zealand at Edgbaston and, topping the list, a 46-ball onslaught against Pakistan in Dubai. He has also shone at the IPL, and quickly became a senior player in the Test side since his surprise recall in 2018.Softly-spoken and unassuming, with supple hands and a great eye, Buttler kills opposing attacks with kindness, with a graceful flip shot for six over long-on and the occasional resort to a nerveless ramp shot over the wicketkeeper among his most eye-catching shots in an inventive repertoire. Like his captain, Eoin Morgan, his unflustered response to even the most daunting run chase is one of his greatest assets, his steely resolve hidden beneath a benign exterior. Such was his impact for Mumbai Indians in his first appearance in IPL in 2016, capable of mayhem late in the innings, that for a young cricket follower in India with only Twenty20 in their heart, it was possible to imagine that England had rarely, if ever, produced a player of such star quality. As he entered his 30s, Buttler reached a new level in short-form cricket, becoming indisputably one of the world's best T20 batters. In 2022, he hit 863 runs in the IPL - the second-most in a single season - including four centuries to take Rajasthan Royals to the final. Later in the year, after taking over from Eoin Morgan as England's white-ball captain, he led them to their second men's T20 World Cup title as they achieved their long-stated ambition to hold both World Cups simultaneously. As Buttler and his old friend Alex Hales knocked off a target of 170 with four overs and 10 wickets to spare against India in the semi-final at Adelaide, it seemed bizarre that his promotion to open the batting for England's T20 team on a permanent basis in 2018 had been so controversial at the time.Buttler was in the crowd at Taunton as a young spectator during the 1999 World Cup when India's Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid thrashed what was then the highest partnership in ODI cricket. He was hooked. Somerset gained special permission from the ECB to add him to their Academy at 12, two years early, and he came to prominence as a 19-year-old in the 2010 season for Somerset, especially in the one-day arena where his clear-minded and quick-footed aggressive batting helped him to 440 CB40 runs at 55.00. He made his first-class debut against Lancashire at Taunton in 2009 and became a regular in the County Championship from May 2010 - playing a part in Somerset's title challenge that season. He combined in particularly potent fashion with Kieron Pollard in Somerset's run to Twenty20 Finals Day in both 2010 and 2011, and impressed in the 2011 CB40 final, making 86 from 72 balls in Somerset's defeat to Surrey.He made his international debut in late 2011 and became a fixture of England's T20 side. A first ODI appearance came against Pakistan in the UAE during the winter, though he had to wait almost a year for his second cap, this time as wicketkeeper. When Ashley Giles took over as limited-overs coach one of his first key decision was to ditch Craig Kieswetter for Buttler on a tour of India. With Kieswetter still preferred as Somerset's gloveman, it was that rivalry that caused Buttler to leave his beloved West Country and switch to Lancashire for the 2014 season. Lancashire saw him for 10 Championship matches, but it was soon apparent he would be making only fleeting visits in the future.England looked to him for impetus and increasingly he delivered, striking 99 against West Indies at North Sound and kicking off the 2014 ODI summer with a first hundred against Sri Lanka at Lord's as he led a failed run chase virtually single-handed. When Matt Prior became stricken by Achilles trouble - what proved to be a career-ending injury - the selectors gambled by throwing Buttler into the Test team. He scored five half-centuries in his first eight Tests, including 85 on debut against India at the Ageas Bowl, but his form faltered and he lost the gloves to Jonny Bairstow on England's tour of the UAE in 2015-16, during a period where his keeping started to make necessary improvements but his batting slip away.There were no such doubts about his place in the white-ball teams. His seniority was recognised when he was named Morgan's vice-captain for the 2015 World Cup and, although that tournament was an unhappy one for England, Buttler was a key member of the side that reached the final of the World T20 a year later. His dynamic batting was emblematic of England's one-day reinvention under Morgan, though he also began to demonstrate increased range to his game - when he led England to an extraordinary one-wicket win over Australia at Old Trafford in 2018, his unbeaten 110 from 122 balls was by far the slowest hundred of his career.Amid increasing demand on the T20 circuit, which included spells in the Bangladesh Premier League and Australia's Big Bash, Buttler's Test star seemed to be waning. He was briefly recalled in India in 2016-17 but then spent more than a year on the fringes, and was even overlooked as Bairstow's back-up during the following winter's Ashes tour. However, his stellar form for Rajashtan Royals in the 2018 IPL - he equalled the league record for consecutive fifties - prompted Smith to pick up the phone. Impressive contributions against Pakistan followed, and then, at long last, a maiden Test hundred, recorded in defeat to India at Trent Bridge. Suddenly, Buttler was integral in all three formats once again.He remained integral to the 50-over side building into the World Cup, and started the tournament itself in flying form with 103 off 76 balls in a defeat against Pakistan and a quick half-century against Bangladesh. But time at the middle was limited through the rest of the group stage, and England were so dominant in the semi-final against Australia that he was not required. In the final, his skill in run chases came to the fore: coming in with England wobbling at 86 for 4 in a chase of 242, he kept them alive with 59 off 60 balls in a 110-run stand with Ben Stokes, and while he could not see them home, he managed seven runs off three balls in the Super Over, and completed the run-out of Martin Guptill to win England the trophy.The highs of World Cup success were quickly forgotten, as Buttler cut a tired figure over the next six months. He struggled for runs in the Ashes and in South Africa, and with Bairstow and Ben Foakes breathing down his neck, it seemed a matter of time before he would lost his Test place. He responded with a breathless 75 off 101 in the home summer against Pakistan to seal a run chase at Old Trafford, before grinding out his highest Test score - 152 - in the final match of the series. By this stage firmly ensconced as England's T20I opener, he continued to lead from the front in their bid to hold both World Cups simultaneously.\nESPNcricinfo staff",

    "description": "One of the fastest scorers in world cricket, Glenn Maxwell has lit up the limited-overs formats. His ability to make unconventional shots - reverse sweeps and pulls, for example -appear routine makes it hard to set fields to cover all of his scoring areas. Maxwell's audacity comes with risk, and he can exasperate as well as exhilarate, but at his best he can change a game in moments. Also a handy offspinner and outstanding fielder, Maxwell offers an impressive package in one-day and T20 cricket when things click. In 2017 he made his first Test hundred, against India in Ranchi. He was subsequently briefly dropped from the ODI side but came back and made his third T20I century in Bangalore early in 2019 to help Australia chase 191. The ODI series against Pakistan in the UAE that followed was a high point as well.Late in 2019, Maxwell took a mental-health break from the game. The time away, along with conversations about his role with white-ball captain Aaron Finch, helped revive his form - he made five scores of over 45 in six ODI innings in 2020, had an impressive IPL season with Royal Challengers Bangalore the following year, and in January 2022, became the first batter to breach the 150-run mark in a BBL innings. However, he made little impact in the 2021 and 2022 T20 World Cups.He made his name for Victoria with a 19-ball half-century against Tasmania in 2010-11, the fastest fifty in Australia's one-day domestic history, and transferred that talent to the international stage. At the 2015 World Cup he blasted a 51-ball hundred against Sri Lanka in Sydney, then the fastest for Australia in ODIs, and the second-quickest in World Cup history. Australia have also used Maxwell in Tests but to less effect - patience at the crease has not generally been one of his strengths. However, in Delhi in 2013 he had the distinction of opening the batting and bowling in the same Test, as Australia strove in vain to turn their disastrous series around. He was dropped following the 2017 tour of Bangladesh. \n",

    "description": "By the time Chris Woakes returned from England's tour to South Africa at the start of 2016, he feared his Test career was over. He was 27 by then and had played six Tests. But, despite bowling respectably on almost every outing, he had never quite made the breakthrough and an average of 63.75 made dispiriting reading. It looked as if he may be remembered as one of England's nearly men.But fate offered another chance. A knee injury to Ben Stokes saw Woakes recalled to the squad to play Sri Lanka at Chester-le-Street. On the same day he claimed career-best figures of 9 for 36 against Durham - \"It was like facing 90mph legbreaks,\" Paul Collingwood said - and, with Alastair Cook insisting Woakes' batting gave him the edge (both Paul Farbrace and Trevor Bayliss wanted Jake Ball to play), he made it back into the XI.It was to prove the start of a golden summer. After career-bests to that point with bat and ball at Chester-le-Street, he made a maiden Test half-century at Lord's and followed it with an unbeaten 95 to help England to an unlikely tie in an ODI at Trent Bridge. It was the highest score by a No. 8 or lower in the history of ODIs and helped England recover from 92 for 6 in pursuit of 287.Then, at Lord's, he claimed 11 for 102 against Pakistan, becoming the first England bowler since Ian Botham in 1978 to take a five-wicket haul in each innings of a Test at the ground. He followed it with another seven wickets and a half-century in Manchester and five more wickets in Birmingham. His 26 wickets at 16.73 apiece were a record in a series between England and Pakistan. Woakes, finally, had arrived at the top level. He was named one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year for his efforts.In many ways it was a surprise it had taken so long. Woakes had long been a highly respected player at county level. He made his first-class debut for Warwickshire in 2006 as a 17-year-old and, before he was 20, was topping the county's bowling averages with impressive control and an ability to swing the ball both ways. Most of all, though, he impressed with an apparently unflappable temperament that Ashley Giles, director of cricket at Warwickshire, admitted he would like \"to clone\" as the template for all players.After two more solid county seasons, he was selected on the England Lions tour of the West Indies in 2010, where he performed admirably and was deemed ready for the next step. He made his international debut in a T20 in Adelaide in January 2011 and kept his cool to hit the winning runs in a thrilling one-wicket victory. A few weeks later, he claimed 6 for 45 at Brisbane - the second-best figures by an Englishman in ODIs. Back in the UK, Woakes enjoyed another superb summer in first-class cricket with 56 wickets at 21.78 and 579 runs at 48.25. Most of his chances for England came with the white ball, playing sporadically over the next couple of years, before being handed a Test debut at the end of the 2013 Ashes. He performed respectably on a flat pitch, but it was felt he lacked the pace to prosper at Test level and he was left out of the Ashes squad for the return tour to Australia. Having worked hard to add that pace, Woakes was recalled in place of Stokes in the summer of 2014 and played three Test in succession against India. He enjoyed no luck, but demonstrated the skill and control to suggest he had a future at that level. But a succession of injuries - and the development of Stokes - saw him slip back among the chasing pack and he lost his central contract at the end of 2015.The following summer changed his fortunes, and his growing reputation was rewarded in 2017 by a first IPL contract. But having been expected to lead England's attack in the Champions Trophy, he instead pulled up after bowling just two overs in their opening match and missed the rest of the tournament. A difficult Ashes tour followed and he was dropped from the Test side in New Zealand - his bowling average away from home having risen to 61.77 - but he bounced back during the English summer, scoring a maiden Test century, against India at Lord's.A year later Woakes helped England to secure a dramatic, maiden World Cup win - his importance never more apparent than during the new-ball spell that helped reduce Australia to 14 for 3 in the semi-final at Edgbaston. Improvements with the Kookaburra ball were apparent during one-off appearances in New Zealand and South Africa that winter, and his mastery at home saw him named PCA Player of the Year in 2020, having averaged 20.24 in five behind-closed-doors Tests against West Indies and Pakistan, as well as scoring an unbeaten 84 at Old Trafford to secure a fourth-innings chase of 277 by three wickets.George Dobell",

    "description": "- For one season, Pat Cummins held the record for the fastest fifty in IPL - jointly with KL Rahul - after he got to the mark in 14 balls when playing for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) against Mumbai Indians (MI) in 2022. Cummins' record was broken by Rajasthan Royals' (RR) Yashasvi Jaiswal in 2023 by one ball.- For a little under two hours, Cummins was the most expensive player procured at an IPL auction when he was sold to Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) for INR 20.50 crore (US$2.47 million approx.) in the auction held a month after he had led Australia to the 2023 ODI World Cup title.- At the same auction, compatriot Mitchell Starc shattered the record when he attracted a winning bid of INR 24.75 crore (US$2.98 million approx.) from Cummins' former team, KKR.- Cummins went on to become the second Australian to lead SRH - after David Warner - despite never having captained any side in a senior T20 competition before.- He was the third Australian captain of an IPL team from Hyderabad. Both Adam Gilchrist, who led Deccan Chargers, and Warner delivered IPL titles before Cummins.Earmarked as a potential star from a young age, Pat Cummins made his Test debut as an 18-year-old but had to wait six years for his next appearance as injuries struck a body that could not withstand the workload. The bowler who emerged in 2017 was a thoroughbred quick who became one of the standout players in the world and, in late 2021, Australia's Test captain in dramatic circumstances.Cummins burst onto the scene with a sensational Test debut, taking a match total of seven wickets to set up a thrilling two-wicket win to square the series against South Africa at the Wanderers. He had made his debut for New South Wales during the 2010-11 season and was particularly impressive in his maiden Big Bash season. Touted to be a future leader of Australia's pace attack, he was offered a central contract for 2011-12, becoming the youngest player to be contracted since the current system was introduced in 1998.Then came the injuries. He suffered repeated stress fractures in his lower back and did not play another Test for six years, until the 2017 tour of India. But all the pain and rehab of those intervening years appeared to have been worthwhile as his body toughened up to the rigours of international cricket.In the wake of Australia's ball-tampering scandal he became arguably the nation's shining light in a cricketing sense. He was absent through the various 2018 winter tours immediately after the controversy due to a back injury but was monumental in the losing home series against India and was subsequently rewarded with the Test vice-captaincy against Sri Lanka. He became the No. 1 ranked Test bowler in the world and claimed Australia's coveted Allan Border Medal as the 2018-19 men's cricketer of the year. He was immense during the 2019 Ashes in England and through another home series defeat against India in 2020-21, typified by a relentlessness with ball in hand and tremendous stamina.Having been identified as a future captain, his rise to the position came earlier than expected when Tim Paine resigned shortly before the 2021-22 Ashes. However, in a mark of the cricketer and leader Cummins had become it was, given the circumstances, almost a seamless transition. A few months later he had retained the Ashes and secured victory in Pakistan on Australia's first tour of the country in 24 years.\nESPNcricinfo staff",

    "description": "- After missing IPL 2023 with a back injury, Shreyas Iyer has returned to lead Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in IPL 2024, though he has continued to have issues with his back.- Iyer, a middle-order batter who excels against spin, joined KKR in IPL 2022 as their captain after spending his first seven IPL seasons at Delhi Capitals (DC).- He was named Emerging Player of the Year for scoring 436 runs in his debut IPL season in 2015, and in 2018 he replaced Gautam Gambhir as DC captain after the season had begun.- In 2019, Iyer led DC to the IPL playoffs for the first time after six years, and in 2020 he captained them to their first IPL final, where they lost to Chennai Super Kings.- Iyer missed the first half of IPL 2021 because of a shoulder injury, and when he returned for the second half of the season, DC decided to continue with Rishabh Pant as their captain. Iyer left DC at the end of that season and began his KKR career the following year.Shreyas Iyer is an attacking top-order batter capable of marrying classical shots with brute force.  He made headlines when Delhi Daredevils bought him at the 2015 IPL auction for Rs 2.6 crore (about US$416,000). It was faith he repaid with interest: he made 439 runs that season, and won the IPL Emerging Player of the Year award. Over the next six seasons, he became a mainstay of the side and its captain, making over 400 runs a season for them four times. Iyer came up through the Under-19 ranks, hitting back-to-back fifties in the 2014 World Cup playoffs to help India finish fifth. He made his first-class debut for Mumbai the next domestic season, and after a lukewarm stint in the middle order, was promoted to opener and finished as the team's top run-getter with 809 runs at an average of over 50. He had a blow-out Ranji Trophy season the next year, with 1321 runs at 73, and made a century in the final, where Mumbai won their 41st title.By then calls for Iyer to be fast-tracked into the India side had grown clamorous, but it took nearly another two years before he made his international debut, in the white-ball formats first. His first hundred for India came in an ODI against New Zealand in Hamilton in 2020, and he made a century and fifty on Test debut against the same side a little over a year and a half later, this time at home. In a Ranchi ODI in October 2022, he made a chase of 282 against South Africa look like a walk in a park with a well-paced unbeaten 113 that took India home with plenty of room to spare.\n",

    "description": "In a career of twists and turns, Steven Smith started out as a legspinner and become Australia's best batter since Sir Donald Bradman, either side of having his career derailed by a ball-tampering scandal that saw him stripped of the captaincy and banned for 12 months.The rise from that controversy at Newlands in 2018 was near-miraculous: Smith returned to Test cricket with a 774-run Ashes series in 2019, and pictures of him in tears at Sydney airport after his return in disgrace from South Africa were replaced in the popular memory with those of triumphant celebrations of centuries. Part of his punishment for Cape Town was being banned from any leadership position for two years, but once he served that penance, in late 2021 he was named Pat Cummins' vice-captain and a few weeks later led the side against England when Cummins was ruled out of a Test by Covid.Smith began his Test career in 2010 as a legspinner who batted at No. 8; by the time he was named Australia's captain five years later, he was the No. 1 Test batter in the world and no more than an occasional bowler. His talent was apparent early, but as a young batter he had more moving parts than an orchestra - only, they didn't always work in harmony. He went away and worked on his game and returned to the Test side two years later with a much tighter technique. He still fidgeted between balls but could play every shot in the book, and a few others that defied words besides. Quick-footed and adept at facing spin, he is equally comfortable driving and pulling the fast bowlers.When he was appointed Australia's 45th Test captain, Smith was filling in for the injured Michael Clarke in three Tests. That was during a markedly purple patch, even by his standards: he produced six hundreds in eight Tests then, against India, West Indies and England. Despite being only 25 at the time, the extra responsibility clearly didn't hamper his run-making, and Smith cemented his spot when Clarke retired at the end of the 2015 Ashes in England.As Smith's batting developed, his bowling became less frequently sighted, although he could still land the odd fizzing legbreak and winkle out a wicket or two. In the field his athleticism and instinct stand out, even in a high-quality fielding side like Australia. He has also been a key man in Australia's ODI side, was his country's leading run-scorer in their triumphant 2015 World Cup campaign, and became captain in all three formats before his career was turned upside down. \n",

    "description": "- Jonny Bairstow made his IPL debut for Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in 2019, and quickly formed a destructive opening pair with David Warner. -  He and Warner had four century stands that year, the most by an opening pair in a single IPL edition. - Bairstow ended the season with 445 runs from ten games, at an average of 55.62 and a strike rate of 157.24. -  SRH released him ahead of the 2022 mega auction, where he was picked up by Punjab Kings. -  Bairstow's first season with Kings was lukewarm, as he scored only 253 runs in 11 games.-   He missed IPL 2023 with a leg injury.Jonny Bairstow, the son of the former England wicketkeeper David Bairstow, is a combative wicketkeeper-batter who has become a cricketer to be reckoned with in England's middle order. The journey was far from easy for Bairstow, especially with Jos Buttler in contention for the gloves, but prolific run-making for Yorkshire eventually made a case that England's selectors could not ignore. Galvanised by his selection, runs flowed.Bairstow's wicketkeeping has rarely met with universal approval and, much to his chagrin, the debate about whether he might be better playing as a specialist batter has never been silenced. But from the moment that he delivered an emotional maiden Test century in Cape Town, where his father had strong off-season links, he began to make a significant mark with England. Nothing could compare with his impact on the one-day team, where his peerless opening partnership with Jason Roy helped deliver England a first World Cup success in 2019.He has had to fight against a tendency to play across the line and, to that end, he stands tall, bat held aloft, adding to his pugnacious image. Driven and independently minded, he is very much his own man. Intensive work with Bruce French, England's wicketkeeping coach, has also made his keeping more secure.Bairstow was a talented all-round sportsman at an early age, even having trials with Leeds United as a right back. But it was cricket which soon dominated. An early starter with Yorkshire's Under-15s, he was named Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year in 2007, having already played for Yorkshire's 2nd XI and their Academy side and represented England Under-17. He soon followed in his father's footsteps by signing a full-time contract with Yorkshire. Jonny was eight-years-old when his father took his own life. Merely to play the game, and for the same county, was courageous enough.He made an impressive first-class debut against Somerset in June 2009, cracking 82 in his second innings, and soon secured his place in the first XI. Further honours followed when he was picked up by England's Performance Programme and included in the England Lions successful tour of the Caribbean in January 2011.By now Yorkshire's first-choice keeper, he registered his maiden first-class hundred against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in May of that year. Having previously passed fifty 17 times in 34 first-class matches without reaching three figures, just to emphasise his breakthrough, he made it a double. During his brilliant attacking innings, he was joined by England's recently retired opening bowler Ryan Sidebottom in a record ninth-wicket partnership for Yorkshire against Nottinghamshire (which had stood since 1899) of 151. Bairstow and Sidebottom were sons of two of Yorkshire's best-loved former players - the passing of talent between the generations could not have been more satisfactorily captured.Many suspected that, long term, Bairstow would become a specialist batter and his debut innings in one-day internationals backed up that theory as he hit an unbeaten 41 off 21 balls against India at Cardiff. A tough India tour showed the realities of international cricket but he bounced back with a match-winning 60 off 46 in a T20I against Pakistan in the UAE and, after a strong start to the 2012 season, he was handed a call-up to the Test squad to face West Indies.It was not a happy series for Bairstow, whose problems against some hostile short bowling from Kemar Roach gained much media attention. He was left out of the opening Test of the South Africa series but, after Kevin Pietersen was dropped in extraordinary circumstances, another opportunity arose for Bairstow to which he responded magnificently. His brilliant 95 at Lord's led an England fightback from 54 for 4, Bairstow emerging from a short-ball peppering to play some fluent attacking shots in an innings former England captain Michael Vaughan said would have been the finest maiden Test century he had witnessed had his fellow Yorkshireman not been bowled by Morne Morkel.He played all five of England's games at the World T20 that winter, averaging just 9.50, and his participation in the India Test series was also limited before he was granted leave to return home because of a family illness. Thereafter his bit-part status congealed - he lost his spot in the T20 team and, after returning to the Test team during the Ashes as England dropped Nick Compton and moved Joe Root up the order, he was abruptly left out at The Oval. A squad member for the return tour of Australia, he played in the last two Tests, replacing the out-of-form Matt Prior, but did not unearth the performances to promote his worth as Prior's long-term successor and had to buckle down to the county circuit the following summer.That 2015 season promised to be the making of him as he struck 1108 first-class runs at 92.33, allowed by Yorkshire to play as he saw fit. Nothing was more emphatic than his 366-run alliance with Tim Bresnan at Chester-le-Street, both players making career-bests in Yorkshire's fifth-highest stand of all time. England were receptive. A combative 83 not out at Chester-le-Street after a late summons settled a weather-hit ODI against New Zealand in England's favour and the faltering form of Buttler brought a Test recall against Australia.It was Cape Town, though, where Bairstow really broke through, as the summer of 2016 testified. Bairstow's second Test ton was reserved for his home crowd against Sri Lanka: 140, batting at No. 7, out of 298. On a challenging surface, he played with a certainty not given to others. England's top order was repeatedly found wanting in Test cricket, but the belligerence of Bairstow and co down the order constantly dug them out of a hole, and another hundred at Lord's followed.His desire was relentless and his growing impact in ODIs was enough for him to return at the top of the order in the Champions Trophy semi-final - a defeat against Pakistan in Cardiff. West Indies felt his frustration at the end of the summer in the form of his first two ODI hundreds.But even as he became increasingly integral to England's white-ball fortunes, vagaries of selection hurt his Test chances. He scored an Ashes hundred on the 2017-18 tour and another in Christchurch a few months later, but pushed up the order to cover for deficiencies in others, his form dipped; he lost the gloves to Ben Foakes due to injury in Sri Lanka - though scored a bristling century when asked to bat as a specialist at No. 3 - and then saw the role handed to Buttler following a 2-2 draw in the 2019 Ashes.Back-to-back hundreds in crunch World Cup group games against New Zealand and India had been pivotal on England's route to the trophy, his opening partnership with Roy already among the most prolific in history. He enhanced his reputation further in the IPL, but in Tests he drifted to the periphery. Ed Smith, the national selector, suggested he needed to work on his red-ball game but rarely did he have the opportunity to do so; a comeback in 2021 only meeting with fitful success.ESPNcricinfo staff",
